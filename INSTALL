(Please read the HACKING file if you're installing from a working copy
rather than an unpacked distribution.)

(Also, if you are trying to set up a subversion server, also look at
www/server_setup.html for instructions on compiling and installing 
Apache 2.0 and mod_dav_svn).

Subversion installs using the usual GNU procedure:

   $ ./configure --enable-maintainer-mode --disable-shared
   $ make
   $ make check
   # make install

The flags to `configure' are highly recommended for developers, as
they build a statically-linked binary.  If you don't use those flags,
then you must reverse the order of the "make check" and "make install"
steps, because the shared libraries must be installed before "make
check" will work.

Additionally, with shared library builds, the destination library directory
must be listed in either /etc/ld.so.conf or $LD_LIBRARY_PATH (for linux
systems), so that subversion will be able to dynamically load repository
access plugins.  If you try to do a checkout and see an error like:

svn_error: #21068 : <Bad URL passed to RA layer>
  Unrecognized URL scheme: http://svn.collab.net/repos/svn/trunk

It probably means that the dynamic loader/linker can't find the subversion
libraries.

Note that if you commonly build with the -jN option to make, the make step
above may fail, because we don't ensure that third party libraries in our
source tree will finish building before subversion itself.  If you want
to use -jN, use the following instead:

   $ ./configure --enable-maintainer-mode --disable-shared
   $ make -jN external-all
   $ make -jN local-all
   $ make check
   # make install

(See www/server_setup.html for how to set up the Subversion server.)


PREREQUISITES:

1. Berkeley DB 3.3.11

   Berkely DB is needed to build a Subversion server.  If you are only 
   interested in building a Subversion client, you don't need it.  If
   you wish to build a server, read the rest of this section.

   You'll need Berkeley DB 3.3.11 or higher installed on your system.
   You can get it from:

      http://www.sleepycat.com

   If you already have another version of Berkeley DB installed and
   don't want to downgrade, you can unpack the Berkeley 3.3.11
   distribution into a subdir named `db' in the top-level of the
   Subversion source tree.  Then Subversion will ignore the system DB
   and use the one it found in its own source tree.  Alternatively,
   you can add this flag

      --with-berkeley-db=/usr/local/BerkeleyDB.3.3

   to your `configure' switches, and the build process will use the
   named Berkeley.  You may need to use a different path, of course.

2. Python 2.1

   If you want to run "make check", install Python 2.1 or higher on
   your system, as the test suite is written in Python.  Get it from
   http://www.python.org/.

3. Clean up any previous Subversion installs first!

   Your build may appear to succeed, but actually link incorrectly, if
   there are old Subversion shared libraries on your system.  If
   you've installed Subversion shared libraries in the past, you must
   be sure to clean them out before building a newer version.  Usually
   this does the trick:

      # rm -f /usr/local/lib/libsvn*
      # rm -f /usr/local/lib/libapr*
      # rm -f /usr/local/lib/libexpat*
      # rm -f /usr/local/lib/libneon*

Please mail dev@subversion.tigris.org if you have any problems.
