If you're looking for a task to take on, please see the TASKS file.

This file merely lists immediate, short-term (next few days) stuff on
people's stacks.  It may make reference to phone conversations and
private emails, so a given item might not make much sense unless one
is familiar with its out-of-band context.  We keep this file under
version control mainly for convenience -- feel free to add your own
short-term tasks to it, if that's helpful.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Ben todo:
   - adm_crawler.c: almost done with props!!  big bug still:  after
     sending local propchanges to editor callbacks, and if the commit
     is successful, we need a log entry to move the local propfile to
     the pristine propfile.

   - update-after-editor: isn't printing `G' for prop merges.  isn't
     printing `C' for either textual or property conflicts.  fix this.

   - stupid `M' bug only shows up in certain status commands!!!
        
   - redo syntax of client, especially for property commands.  stop
     using --target-dir for anything but update or checkout.  use new
     apr longopts.

   - look at all calls to svn_wc__get_local_propchanges.  Notice how
     it's always the same code preceding the call?  Perhaps we should
     therefore put this code *inside* get_local_propchanges, and
     change the interface to said func.

   - use karl's forthcoming "magic" adm/entryname routine whereever
     possible, once it exists.

Karl working copy todo:
   - write the log/lock recovery function.
   - with Ben, review locking protocol in wc adm directories for sanity.
   - check apr_open calls, do they assume failure implies null handle?
   - fix working copy identification/allergy code
   - make sure type-changing replacements work right
   - turn log.c:start_handler() into a dispatcher, like Ben described
   - do the generic entry/adm-path grabber abstraction, as talked
     about with Ben, change everyone around to use it (chore, whoa).

Ben and Karl more later:
   - xml dtd, for both xml deltas and wc formats

Greg:
   - mod_dav_svn:
      - finish repository hooks (waiting on FS a bit)
	defer mkcol/copy/move/delete.

      - liveprop hooks:
	core: getcontentlength, creationdate, getetag,
	      getlastmodified,
	deltav: target

      - vsn hooks: ???  REPORT and MKACTIVITY first

   - mod_dav: no apparent changes until vsn comes in
      - need: MKACTIVITY, MERGE
      - verify Vasta's work against our needs: CHECKOUT, REPORT, LABEL

   - libsvn_ra_dav:
      - update editor
      - commit editor

   - APR: move apr_copy_file() from SVN. and apr_append_file, etc.

   - security checks (e.g. system() usage in wc/get_editor)
