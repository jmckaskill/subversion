If you're looking for a task to take on, please see the TASKS file.

This file merely lists immediate, short-term (next few days) stuff on
people's stacks.  It may make reference to phone conversations and
private emails, so a given item might not make much sense unless one
is familiar with its out-of-band context.  We keep this file under
version control mainly for convenience -- feel free to add your own
short-term tasks to it, if that's helpful.

Ben & Karl todo:

   - clean up the interface in libsvn_client.  make it more canonical.
     (This may happen automatically as the Win32 and Gnome clients are
      developed after-hours!)

   - trace editor:  trace commits.

Ben todo:

   - make a new mini-crawler (lots of shared code with adm_crawler.c)
     which reports "version differences" to an editor.  this will be
     used to communicate the working copy's state to the repository
     *before* receiving an update.

Karl wc todo:

   - Propagate changes down into libsvn_client.  Currently, the client
     usually takes a `targets' list and iterates over it, invoking
     some libsvn_client routine each time.  There are cases where the
     libsvn_client routine should get the target list directly and do
     the iteration internally, or even pass the list on down into
     libsvn_wc.
   - make an is_textfile test, so at least we can create .alt files
     instead of .rej for those that `patch' can't handle.
   - write the log/lock recovery function.
   - with Ben, review locking protocol in wc adm directories for sanity.
   - check apr_open calls, do they assume failure implies null handle?
   - fix working copy identification/allergy code
   - make sure type-changing replacements work right
   - do the generic entry/adm-path grabber abstraction, as talked
     about with Ben, change everyone around to use it (chore, whoa).

Ben and Karl (longer term):

   - xml dtd, for both xml deltas and wc formats

   - for milestone 3: TREE DELTAS.  Quake before them.  This problem
     has many aspects to it, *including* {the need for commands to
     take lists of paths, canconicalizing these lists, testing paths
     if they exist and/or what their entries say about them, etc.}
     Just a tip of the iceberg.

Greg:

   - mod_dav_svn:
      - finish repository hooks (waiting on FS a bit)
        need: MKCOL, DELETE, GET, PUT
	defer copy/move

      - liveprop hooks:
	core: getcontentlength, creationdate, getetag,
	      getlastmodified, resourcetype
	deltav: target, activity-collection-set, version-name

      - vsn hooks: ???  REPORT and MKACTIVITY first
        REPORT: need the SVN:status-report
        need: CHECKOUT
	need: MERGE (activity)
	validate proper support for VERSION-CONTROL. this would be the 
	  missing piece for DeltaV "Core" support.

   - mod_dav: no apparent changes until vsn comes in
      - need: MKACTIVITY, MERGE
      - verify Vasta's work against our needs: CHECKOUT, REPORT, LABEL
      - defer LABEL support
      - probably need BASELINE-CONTROL

   - libsvn_ra_dav:
      - update editor
      - commit editor

   - APR: move apr_copy_file() from SVN. and apr_append_file, etc.

   - security checks (e.g. system() usage in wc/get_editor)

Filesystem:

  (Branko and Karl have made this list here to keep straight the order in
  which they're doing stuff in the fs.)

  Let's get these working and tested in fs-test.c:

    1.  svn_fs_begin_txn()
    2.  svn_fs_abort_txn()
    3.  svn_fs_close_txn()
    4.  svn_fs_txn_name()
    5.  svn_fs_open_txn()
    6.  svn_fs_list_transactions()

  These don't do anything useful by themselves, of course, but they're
  prerequisites for:

    7.  Begin, open a txn
    8.  Make a change to some node in that txn
    9.  Get txn's name
    10. close the txn
    11. re-open the same txn, by name
    12. check that our change is still there!

  I'm not sure yet what specific functions are required to implement
  steps 7-12; we'll first establish the concrete list of functions,
  then implement them.

  Once that's working, we can do the Big One: svn_fs_commit_txn(). :-)
