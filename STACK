If you're looking for a task to take on, please see the TASKS file.

This file merely lists immediate, short-term (next few days) stuff on
people's stacks.  It may make reference to phone conversations and
private emails, so a given item might not make much sense unless one
is familiar with its out-of-band context.  We keep this file under
version control mainly for convenience -- feel free to add your own
short-term tasks to it, if that's helpful.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Ben todo:
   - timestamp code:  track *both* text and property timestamps independently. 
   - split modified_p() into two versions -- one for text, one for props
   - get_editor.c (close_file):  new logic to anywhere from 0 to 2 timestamps,
     depending on whether local mods are detected.
   - props.c:  output conflict values too
   - adm_crawler.c: finish emitting properties and doing proper
     conflict detection

Karl working copy todo:
   - use apr process api instead of system(), don't use redirection
   - write the log/lock recovery function.
   - with Ben, review locking protocol in wc adm directories for sanity.
   - check apr_open calls, do they assume failure implies null handle?
   - fix working copy identification/allergy code
   - make sure type-changing replacements work right

Ben and Karl more later:
   - xml dtd, for both xml deltas and wc formats

Greg:
   - mod_dav_svn:
      - finish repository hooks (waiting on FS a bit)
	defer mkcol/copy/move/delete.
	walker API now clean: implement ours. (needed for checkout)

      - liveprop hooks:
	core: getcontentlength, creationdate, getetag,
	      getlastmodified,
	deltav: target

      - vsn hooks: ???  REPORT and MKACTIVITY first
      - deadprop hooks: stub at first

   - mod_dav: no apparent changes until vsn comes in
      - need: MKACTIVITY, MERGE
      - need CHECKOUT, but most of it is there; just verify

   - libsvn_ra_dav:
      - update editor
      - commit editor

   - APR: move apr_copy_file() from SVN. and apr_append_file, etc.

   - security checks (e.g. system() usage in wc/get_editor)
