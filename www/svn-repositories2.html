       backup back and then wondering why svn update was failing.

    years, the Theta engine hasn't been under version control (as it
    was just me, it was more effort than it was worth), but recently
    as the project has been speeding up, I've put it under version
    control. I first considered CVS, but I'm glad I didn't... svn is
    quite good, even at this pre-release stage.
