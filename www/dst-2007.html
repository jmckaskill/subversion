<h2 style="text-align: center">Statement of Support for 2007 Daylight
Saving Time Changes</h2>

<p>In August 2005 the US Congress passed the Energy Policy Act, which
changes the dates of both the start and end of daylight saving time
(DST).  When this law goes into effect in 2007, DST will start three
weeks earlier (2:00 A.M. on the second Sunday in March) and will
end one week later (2:00 A.M. on the first Sunday in November)
than what had traditionally occurred.  This change was not universally 
adopted by all countries.  For more information see: <a

http://webexhibits.org/daylightsaving/b.html</a></p>

<p>These changes to DST do not require any special changes or fixes to
the Subversion code.  Subversion primarily uses dates/times to record
when changes have been committed to the repository.  This code runs
on the server and gets the current date/time from the operating system
and converts it to UTC using routines provided by the operating system.
The Subversion client receives these dates from the server and converts
them to the local time zone for display using routines provided by
the client operating system.  As such, you should only need to install
the patches provided for your operating system and really you should
only need to make sure the time on the server is properly adjusted
for DST.</p>
