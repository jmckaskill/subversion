<h1>Subversion 1.2 Release Notes</h1>
</center>

<p>These new features will ultimately be documented in a 1.2 version
of the free Subversion book; check the <a
href="http://svnbook.red-bean.com">svnbook.red-bean.com</a> site.


<h3>Overview</h3>

<p>Subversion 1.2 can best be summarized as: (1) a new locking
feature, (2) full DAV autoversioning, (3) faster 'svn blame', and (4)
a large number of improved APIs.  Details are given below.</p>

<p>Subversion 1.2 is a superset of all previous Subversion
releases.  The 1.0.x and 1.1.x releases contain nothing but critical
bugfixes backported from the 1.2 development line.  Subversion 1.2,
however, introduces new features and fixes many additional bugs.</p>

<p>Note that the 1.0.x line is no longer supported.  This doesn't mean
that your 1.0 installation is doomed; if it works well and is all you
need, that's fine.  By "no longer supported", we simply mean that bug
reports are no longer accepted on 1.0.x versions, nor will there be
any more 1.0.x releases.</p>

<h3>Compatibility Concerns</h3>

<p>Subversion's compatibility and version-numbering policy is
    documented in the project's <a
    href="http://svn.collab.net/repos/svn/trunk/HACKING">HACKING</a>
    file.  Here's a quick summary:</p>

<ul>

<li><p><em>Database schema</em>: if upgrading to Subversion 1.2, there
        is <strong>no need</strong> to dump and load your repository.
        There will be no changes requiring dump/load before Subversion
        2.0.</p></li>

<li><p><em>Client/server compatibility</em>: a 1.X client and 1.Y
        server are always interoperable.  However, the latest features
        or bugfixes may not be available unless both client and server
        are the latest version.</p></li>

<li><p><em>API/ABI compatibility</em>: the 1.2 release only adds new
        functions; thus a 1.0 or 1.1 program can both compile against
        and use 1.2 libraries at run-time, but a 1.2 program cannot
        use 1.0 or 1.1 libraries.</p></li>

</ul>


<h3>New Features</h3>

<h4>File Locking (<em>requires new client and server</em>)</h4>

<p>
   - locking files only
   - reiterate goals:  1. forced serialization of write access,
                       2. prevention of wasted time.  
                    -->  explain how goals are achieved
   - point to func-spec and ui docs.
   - quick overview of feature
         --> note that locking can be totally disabled via pre-lock hook.
</p>

<p/>

<h4>Full DAV autoversioning (<em>mod_dav_svn feature</em>)</h4>

<p>Autoversioning is a feature whereby generic WebDAV clients can
write to a DeltaV server (like mod_dav_svn), and the server performs
commits silently in the background.  This means that if you use Apache
httpd as your Subversion server, then most modern operating systems
can mount the repository as a network share, and non-technical users
get "transparent" versioning for free.  (Of course, technical users
can still use Subversion clients to examine repository history.)</p>

<p>Prior to Subversion 1.2, mod_dav_svn had only partial
interoperability with generic DAV clients.  <a
href="http://svnbook.red-bean.com/en/1.1/apc.html">Appendix C</a> in
the Subversion 1.1 book documented the trials and tribulations of this
exercise.  At most, one could use a DAV client to drag files into a
mounted repository, but the files couldn't edited directly from the
network share.  Some clients even refused to mount the Subversion
repository.</p>

<p>Now that the repository supports locking, generic DAV clients can
happily issue http LOCK and UNLOCK requests, and files can be
opened/edited directly from the share.  As far as we can tell,
mod_dav_svn is now fully implementing the 'autoversioning' feature
according to the <a
href="http://greenbytes.de/tech/webdav/#draft-ietf-webdav-rfc2518bis">RFC2518bis</a>
specification.</p>

<p>In informal tests, we've had success reading and writing to
Subversion repositories via Windows Webfolders, OS X Finder, Gnome
Nautilus, KDE Konqueror, and other DAV clients.</p>

<p>To activate autoversioning, simply set <tt>SVNAutoversioning
on</tt> in your httpd.conf's Subversion <tt>Location</tt> block.</p>

<p/>


<h4>Improved 'svn blame' speed (<em>requires new client and
server</em>)</h4>

<p>The speed of 'svn blame' is now about five times faster.  However,
to reach this nirvana, you must do three things:</p>

<ul>
<li>Use a 1.2 client.</li>
<li>Use a 1.2 server.</li>
<li>Dump and reload the repository.</li>
</ul>

<p>The 1.2 client and server are using a new technique to transmit
file history over the network, but that's not enough to get the full
speedup.  The dump and reload is necessary because the repository is
now using a new binary-differencing algorithm (xdelta) to store
compressed versions of files.  xdelta is much faster at reconstructing
differences than the older vdelta algorithm.  By dumping and reloading
the repository, you're forcing the repository to recompress all
history using the xdelta algorithm.</p>



</p>

<p/>


<h3>Other Improvements</h3>

<dl>

<dt><h4>Faster xdelta binary compression (<em>new server
feature</em>)</h4></dt>

<dd>

<p>As mentioned above, the repository is now using the xdelta
binary-differencing algorithm (instead of vdelta) to store compressed
binary difference data.  When you upgrade to Subversion 1.2, existing
repositories will continue to work fine; the history will simply be a
mixture of both vdelta- and xdelta-compressed differences.</p>

<p>The xdelta algorithm is much faster at reconstructing older files,
and thus (as mentioned already) you might have incentive to dump and
reload your existing repository.  This would cause all your history to
be recompressed using xdelta.  As a result, not only will <tt>svn
blame</tt> be much faster, but any other operation that depends on
examining history or constructing differences: <tt>svn checkout</tt>,
<tt>svn diff</tt>, <tt>svn merge</tt>, and so on.  Even dumping the
repository will be faster.</p>

<p/>

<dt><h4>FSFS repositories are now the default (<em>new server
feature</em>)</h4></dt>

<dd>

<p>After the widespread success of FSFS repositories since the 1.1
release, we've changed the <tt>svnadmin create</tt> command now to
create FSFS repositories by default.  Everyone agrees that this will
provide a much friendlier "out of box" experience for new users.</p>

<p><strong>Please note</strong>: BerkeleyDB repositories are
<strong>not</strong> being phased out or deprecated in any way.  The
reliability problems we've seen lie not in BerkeleyDB itself, but in
the unique way Subversion uses BerkeleyDB.  Cooperative work is
currently underway (with Sleepycat engineers) to address these issues.
BerkeleyDB repositories are still older and better-tested than FSFS
repositories in terms of scalability; the project still recommends you
<a
href="http://svnbook.red-bean.com/en/1.1/ch05.html#svn-ch-5-sect-1.3">read
about the two back-ends in the book</a> and make an informed
choice.</p>

</dd>

<p/>


<dt><h4>Bugfixes:</h4></dt>
<dd>More than N bugs fixed.  See the <a
href="http://svn.collab.net/repos/svn/trunk/CHANGES">CHANGES</a> file
      for details.</dd>

<p>

<dt><h4>New subcommand switches:</h4></dt>
<dd>
   <dl>
      <dt><tt>svn log --limit N</tt></dt>
      <dd>display only N revisions, then stop.  (<em>Note: a 1.2
      server isn't required for this, but strongly recommended.  A
      non-1.2 server will still attempt to deliver all revisions over
      the network, even though the 1.2 client isn't displaying them.</em>)</dd>

   </dl>
</dl>



<h3>Developer Changes</h3>

<p>The svn_ra.h API has now been "flattened", essentially imitating
the same way the svn_fs.h API hides multiple implementations.  Instead
of making calls into an RA vtable (<tt>ra->do_foo()</tt>), all RA
functions are now usable directly in the form
<tt>svn_ra_do_foo()</tt>. This also has the nice side-effect of
making svn_ra.h available via SWIG. </p>

<p>As with svn 1.1, a number of new 1.2 functions have been introduced
with the "2" suffix, and the older versions are now marked deprecated
(and will be removed in Subversion 2.0).  See the <a
href="http://svn.collab.net/repos/svn/trunk/CHANGES">CHANGES</a> file
for details.</p>

<p>There has been extensive work on the python, perl, and java
bindings.  We also now have a preliminary set of ruby bindings.  -->
Yada yada, give details.</p>
