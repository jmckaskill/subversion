<p style="font-style: italic">Subversion 1.4.0 has NOT yet been
released!  This document is a draft &nbsp;&mdash;we're using it as a
checklist for the tasks that remain.  When this warning disappears,
that will mean 1.4.0 is released.</p>

<h2>What's New in Subversion 1.4</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Path-based authorization for svnserve</li>
  <li>Improved logging and repository listing in mod_dav_svn</li>  
  <li>Hugely improved python and ruby bindings</li>
  <li>A handful of new commandline switches</li>
  <li>Some client and server performance improvements</li>
  <li>Many improved APIs</li>
  <li>More than 30 new bugfixes</li>
</ul>

<p>Details are described below.</p>

<p>Subversion 1.4 is a superset of all previous Subversion releases.
Anything in 1.0.x, 1.1.x, 1.2.x or 1.3.x is also in 1.4, but 1.4
contains features and bugfixes not present in any earlier release.
The new features will eventually be documented in a 1.4 version of the
free Subversion book, see <a
href="http://svnbook.red-bean.com">svnbook.red-bean.com</a>.</p>

<div class="h2" id="compatibility" title="compatibility">
<h2>Compatibility Concerns</h2>

<p>Older clients and servers interoperate transparently with 1.4
servers and clients.  Of course, some of the new 1.4 features may not
be available unless both client and server are the latest version.
There is <strong>no need</strong> to upgrade your repositories;
Subversion 1.4 can read repositories created by earlier versions.  To
upgrade an existing installation, just install the newest libraries
and binaries on top of the older ones.</p>

<p>Subversion 1.4 maintains API/ABI compatibility with earlier
releases, by only adding new functions.  A program written to the 1.0,
1.1, 1.2 or 1.3 API can both compile and run using 1.4 libraries.
However, a program written for 1.4 cannot necessarily compile or run
against older libraries.</p>

<div class="h3" id="wc-format-change" title="wc-format-change">
<h3>Working Copy Format Change</h3>

<p>Due to certain improvements and bugfixes made to the working copy
library, the version number of the working copy format has been
incremented. This means that Subversion clients earlier than 1.4 will
<i>not</i> be able to work with working copies produced by Subversion
1.4.</p>

<p><b>WARNING:</b> if Subversion 1.4 encounters a pre-1.4 working
copy, it will <i>automatically</i> upgrade the working copy format as
soon as it touches it, making it impossible for previous versions of
svn to use.  If you are using several versions of Subversion on your
machine, you need to be careful about which version you use in which
working copy, to avoid accidentally upgrading the wc structure.</p>

<div class="h3" id="output-changes" title="output-changes">
<h3>Command Line Output Changes</h3>

<p>Although the Subversion developers try hard to keep output from the
command line programs compatible between releases, new information
sometimes has to be added.  This might break scripts that rely on the
exact format of the output.  In 1.4, the following changes have been
made to the output:</p>

<ul>

<li><p>TODO</p></li>

<h2>Subversion 1.2.x series no longer supported</h2>

<p>The Subversion 1.2.x line is no longer supported.  This doesn't
mean that your 1.2 installation is doomed; if it works well and is all
you need, that's fine.  "No longer supported" just means we've stopped
accepting bug reports against 1.2.x versions, and will not make any
more 1.2.x bugfix releases, except perhaps for absolutely critical
security or data-loss bugs.</p>
