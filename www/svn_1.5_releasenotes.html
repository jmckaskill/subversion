<p>Details are described below.</p>

<p>Subversion 1.5 is a superset of all previous Subversion releases,
and is considered the current "best" release.  Anything in 1.0.x
through 1.4.x is also in 1.5, but 1.5 contains features and bugfixes
not present in any earlier release.  The new features will eventually
be documented in a 1.5 version of the free Subversion book, see <a
href="http://svnbook.red-bean.com">svnbook.red-bean.com</a>.</p>

</div>  <!-- news -->

<div class="h2" id="compatibility" title="compatibility">
<h2>Compatibility Concerns</h2>

<p>Older clients and servers interoperate transparently with 1.5
servers and clients.  Of course, some of the new 1.5 features may not
be available unless both client and server are the latest version
(e.g. <a href="/merge-tracking/func-spec.html#migration-and-interoperability"
>Merge Tracking</a>).  There is <strong>no need</strong> to dump and
reload your repositories; Subversion 1.5 can read repositories created
by earlier versions.  To upgrade an existing installation, just
install the newest libraries and binaries on top of the older
ones.</p>

<p>Subversion 1.5 maintains API/ABI compatibility with earlier
releases, by only adding new functions.  A program written to the 1.0,
1.1, 1.2 or 1.3 API can both compile and run using 1.5 libraries.
However, a program written for 1.5 cannot necessarily compile or run
against older libraries.  However, see the <a href="#apis">API</a>
section on some clarifications on existing APIs.</p>

<div class="h3" id="wc-and-repos-format-change" title="wc-format-change">
<h3>Working Copy and Repository Format Changes</h3>

<p>Due to certain improvements and bugfixes made to the working copy
library, the version number of the working copy format has been
incremented. This means that Subversion clients earlier than 1.5 will
<em>not</em> be able to work with working copies produced by Subversion
1.5.  Similarly, the repository format has changed as well, meaning
that pre-1.5 Subversion tools that normally access a repository
directly (e.g. <tt>svnserve</tt>, <tt>mod_dav_svn</tt>, <tt>svnadmin</tt>)
won't be able to read a repository originally created by Subversion
1.5.</p>

<p><strong>WARNING:</strong> if a Subversion 1.5 client encounters a pre-1.5
working copy, it will <em>automatically</em> upgrade the working copy
format as soon as it touches it, making it unreadable by older
Subversion clients.  If you are using several versions of Subversion
on your machine, you need to be careful about which version you use in
which working copy, to avoid accidentally upgrading the working copy
format.  This "auto upgrade" feature, however, does <em>not</em> occur
with the new repository format.</p>

<p>If you do accidentally upgrade a 1.4 (only) working copy, you can
use <a
href="http://svn.collab.net/repos/svn/trunk/tools/client-side/change-svn-wc-format.py"
>this script</a> to downgrade it back 1.4.  See <a
href="http://subversion.tigris.org/faq.html#working-copy-format-change"

<code>--help</code> option for usage instructions.</p>

<h3>Command Line Output Changes</h3>

<p>Although the Subversion developers try hard to keep output from the
command line programs compatible between releases, new information
sometimes has to be added.  This might break scripts that rely on the
exact format of the output.  In 1.5, the following changes have been
made to the output:</p>

<p>XXX: Enumerate changes to output (e.g. for changelists).</p>

<ul>
  <li><p>Conflict markers in files now match the file's defined

<div class="h3" id="conflict-resolution" title="conflict-resolution">
<h3>Interactive Conflict Resolution (<em>client</em>)</h3>

<p>Added support for interactive conflict resolution in the command
line client, and a corresponding callback function in the client
library.  GUI clients can use the callback function to hook in a
graphical conflict resolution program to the
<code>update</code>/<code>switch</code>/<code>merge</code>
sub-commands.  Example command line output:</p>
<pre>
    $ svn up
    U    contrib/client-side/svnmerge/svnmerge_test.py
    Conflict discovered in 'contrib/client-side/svnmerge/svnmerge.py'.
    Select: (p)ostpone, (d)iff, (e)dit, (h)elp : h
      (p)ostpone - mark the conflict to be resolved later
      (d)iff     - show all changes made to merged file
      (e)dit     - change merged file in an editor
      (r)esolved - accept merged version of file
      (m)ine     - accept my version of file
      (t)heirs   - accept repository's version of file
      (l)aunch   - use third-party tool to resolve conflict
      (h)elp     - show this list

    Select: (p)ostpone, (d)iff, (e)dit, (h)elp : t
    G    contrib/client-side/svnmerge/svnmerge.py
    Updated to revision 25685.
</pre>
<p>This feature can be selectively disabled by using the --non-interactive
option, or disabled permanently by setting '[miscellany] interactive-conflicts
 = no' in your run-time config file.</p>

<p>The API for interactive conflict resolution is exposed via a
callback function and the following new data types:</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>svn_wc_conflict_resolver_func_t</code>, the callback API
    itself</li>
  <li><code>svn_wc_conflict_description_t</code>, a description of the
    conflict passed to the callback</li>
  <li><code>svn_wc_conflict_action_t</code>, the part of the conflict
    description indicating what the merge was trying to do</li>
  <li><code>svn_wc_conflict_reason_t</code>, the part of the conflict
    description indicating the type of conflict</li>
  <li><code>svn_wc_conflict_result_t</code>, returned by the callback
    as the result of any conflict resolution attempt</li>
</ul>

<p>Clients provide their callback function to Subversion's libraries
by setting it on the (new) <code>conflict_func</code> field of their
<code>svn_client_ctx_t</code>, and may provide additional state to the
callback via the corresponding <code>conflict_baton</code> field.</p>

<div class="h3" id="relative-externals" title="relative-externals">
<h3>Relative peg URLs in <tt>svn:externals</tt></h3>

<p>
  Two additions to the <tt>svn:externals</tt> feature
  <ul>
    <li>
      <p>
        The URLs may include peg specifications.  Because the
        directory a URL refers to with and without a peg revision uses
        a different lookup and result in different contents, the
        current format from older versions of Subversion continues to
        not understand peg revisions.  A new format is introduced to
        allow peg revisions in URLs.
      </p>
      <p>
        So the old format of
        <pre>
          foo             http://example.com/repos/zig
          foo/bar -r 1234 http://example.com/repos/zag
        </pre>
        does not support peg revisions.  In fact, these following
        externals will not work unless there are directories named
        <tt>zig@HEAD</tt> and <tt>zag@HEAD</tt>:
        <pre>
          foo             http://example.com/repos/zig@HEAD
          foo/bar -r 1234 http://example.com/repos/zag@HEAD
        </pre>
      </p>
      <p>
        The new format moves the URL first followed by the directory
        the external is checked out or exported into
        <pre>
          http://example.com/repos/zig foo1
          -r 1234 http://example.com/repos/zag foo/bar1
          http://example.com/repos/zig@HEAD foo2
          -r 1234 http://example.com/repos/zag@HEAD foo/bar2
        </pre>
        peg specifications are allowed but not necessary.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        Up to Subversion 1.4, the URLs in an <tt>svn:externals</tt>
        specification must be absolute.  Now they can be relative.
        Four different relative externals are supported.
      </p>
      <p>
        For the following example, assume we have two repositories at
        <tt>http://example.com/svn/repos-1</tt> and
        <tt>http://example.com/svn/repos-2</tt>.  We have a checkout
        of <tt>http://example.com/svn/repos-1/project1/trunk</tt> and
        the <tt>svn:external</tt> property is set on <tt>trunk</tt>.
        <ul>
          <li>
            <tt>../</tt>
            <br/>
            Relative to the directory with the <tt>svn:external</tt>
            property.  These URLs always begin with the string
            <tt>../</tt>.
            <pre>
              ../../project2/trunk common/project2/trunk
            </pre>
            This will extract
            <tt>http://example.com/svn/repos-1/project2/trunk</tt>
            into <tt>common/project2/trunk</tt>.  The URL is relative
            to the directory with the <tt>svn:external</tt>, not the
            directory where the external is written to disk.
          </li>
          <li>
            <tt>^/</tt>
            <br/>
            Relative to the repository root.
            <pre>
              ^/project2/trunk common/project2/trunk
            </pre>
            This will extract
            <tt>http://example.com/svn/repos-1/project2/trunk</tt>
            into <tt>common/project2/trunk</tt>.
            <br/>

            You can also refer to other repositories easily using
            repository root relative URLs:
            <pre>
              ^/../repos-2/foo/trunk common/foo/trunk
            </pre>
            This will extract
            <tt>http://example.com/svn/repos-2/foo/trunk</tt> into
            <tt>common/foo/trunk</tt>
          </li>
          <li>
            <tt>//</tt>
            <br/>
            Relative to the scheme.  This copies the scheme of the
            checkout or export URL into the URL in the
            <tt>svn:external</tt>.  It is useful when the same
            hostname must the accessed with different scheme's
            depending upon network location; i.e. clients in the
            intranet use <tt>http://</tt> while external clients use
            <tt>svn+ssh://</tt>.
            <pre>
              //example.com/svn/repos-1/project2/trunk common/project2/trunk
            </pre>
            This will extract
            <tt>http://example.com/svn/repos-1/project2/trunk</tt>
            into <tt>common/project2/trunk</tt>.  If the working copy
            was checked out from
            <tt>svn+ssh://example.com/svn/repos-1/project1/trunk</tt>
            then this URL would be
            <tt>http://example.com/svn/repos-1/project1/trunk</tt>.
          </li>
          <li>
            <tt>/</tt>
            <br/>

            Server root relative URLs.  This copies the scheme and
            hostname from the checkout or export URL into the
            <tt>svn:external</tt> URL.
            <pre>
              /svn/repos-1/project2/trunk common/project2/trunk
            </pre>
            This will extract
            <tt>http://example.com/svn/repos-1/project2/trunk</tt>
            into <tt>common/project2/trunk</tt>.  If the working copy
            was checked out from
            <tt>svn+ssh://example.com/svn/repos-1/project1/trunk</tt>
            then this URL would be
            <tt>http://example.com/svn/repos-1/project1/trunk</tt>.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <p>
        Relative URLs are supported in the old <tt>svn:externals</tt>
        format that do not support peg revisions.
      </p>
      <p>
        When Subversion sees an <tt>svn:externals</tt> without an
        absolute URL it takes the first argument as a relative URL and
        the second as the target directory.

<h2>Enhancements and Bugfixes</h2>

<div class="h3" id="copy-move-improvements" title="copy-move-improvements">
<h3>Copy/move-related improvements (<em>client and server</em>)</h3>

<p>The abilities and behavior of <code>copy</code> and
<code>move</code> operations has improved significantly.</p>


<div class="h4" id="leverage-copyfrom" title="leverage-copyfrom">
<h4>Improved copy-handling during updates (<em>client and server</em>)</h4>

<p>A common problem in older versions of Subversion was the way in
which <code>svn update</code> handled incoming copies and moves.</p>

<p>For example, suppose Harry runs <code>svn move foo bar; svn
commit</code>, and meanwhile Sally makes local changes to 'foo', and
then runs <code>svn update</code>.  In earlier versions of Subversion,
the server would send down a completely new file 'bar', and remove the
file 'foo' (or rather, make it unversioned, since it has uncommitted
changes.)  From Sally's point of view, her changes seem to be lost;
the newly added 'bar' file has the older content.  In Subversion 1.5,
the client and server both attempt to be smarter about this.  The
server doesn't send a whole new file during the update, but rather
instructions to copy something that may likely already exists in the
working copy.  So Sally's 'foo' file is copied to 'bar' (with local
edits intact!).</p>

<p>In theory, this is the best-case scenario.  There are a few
caveats: this "proper copying" of existing working-copy resources only
works on files, not (yet) on directories.  Also, if an incoming
move-operation deletes 'foo' before it attempts to copy it to 'bar',
then the copy will fail, and the client reverts to the old behavior of
fetching a pristine copy of the file from the repository.  We hope to
address this in svn 1.6.  For details on the this issue see <a
href="http://subversion.tigris.org/issues/show_bug.cgi?id=503">issue
#503</a>.</p>

<div class="h4" id="multi-src-copy" title="multi-src-copy">
<h4>Improved handling multiple copy/move sources (<em>client</em>)</h4>

<p>Clients now accept multiple sources for copy and move operations, with 
the ability to copy/move each of the sources to the specified directory.
This mirrors the behavior of standard command-line copy and move tools,
such as <code>cp</code> and <code>mv</code>.  In practice, this means
users can take advantage of shell globbing when doing a local copy
or move:</p>
<blockquote><code><pre>
svn cp *.c dir
</pre></code></blockquote>

<p>Multiple source copy/move also works for all previously defined
copy/move working copy and repository combinations.  This was

<h3>API changes, improvements and language bindings
    (<em>client and server</em>)</h3>

<p>If you develop a 3rd-party client application that uses Subversion

<ul>
  <li><tt>svn_opt_parse_path()</tt> changes
    <ul>
      <li>
        Since Subversion 1.3, if a path or URL ends in an empty

        Subversion 1.5 fixes this inconsistency, all the above paths
        and URLs return <tt>svn_opt_revision_unspecified</tt>.
      </li>
      <li>
        Since Subversion 1.2, <tt>svn_opt_parse_path</tt> would always
        canonicalize the returned path or URL with
        <tt>svn_path_canonicalize</tt>, even though this is not
        documented in <tt>subversion/include/svn_opt.h</tt>.  For the
        relative externals support, uncanonicalized paths need to be
        returned, otherwise scheme relative URLs,
        i.e. <tt>//example.com/some/path</tt> would be canonicalized
        to server root relative URLs <tt>/example.com/some/path</tt>.
        Users of this function now must ensure that they canonicalize
        the result of this function if they pass it to any other
        Subversion functions that expect a canonicalized path or URL.

<h3>Easier to try out experimental <tt>ra_serf</tt> DAV access module
(<em>client</em>)</h3>

<p>Subversion 1.4 introduced the experimental <tt>ra_serf</tt>
repository access module for accessing HTTP[S] DAV Subversion servers.
This uses the <a href="http://code.google.com/p/serf/">serf</a>
library instead of the Neon library which the original DAV support
uses.  serf supports pipelined requests which may lead to better
performance.  However, Subversion 1.4 required you to choose which
module to use for accessing DAV servers at build time, which made it
difficult to find out which module performs better for your usage
patterns.</p>

<p>Subversion 1.5 allows you to build both modules at the same time;
you can choose which library to use on a global or host-by-host basis
by setting the <tt>http-library</tt> variable in your run-time server
configuration file (<tt>~/.subversion/servers</tt>).  In recognition
of the fact that both libraries are DAV clients, we have
renamed <tt>ra_dav</tt> to <tt>ra_neon</tt>.</p>

<h2>Subversion 1.3.x series no longer supported</h2>

<p>The Subversion 1.3.x line is no longer supported.  This doesn't
mean that your 1.3 installation is doomed; if it works well and is all
you need, that's fine.  "No longer supported" just means we've stopped
accepting bug reports against 1.3.x versions, and will not make any
more 1.3.x bugfix releases, except perhaps for absolutely critical
security or data-loss bugs.</p>
