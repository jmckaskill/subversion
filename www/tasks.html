<h1 style="text-align: center;">What Needs Doing?</h1>

<p>There are a lot of different things you can do to help Subversion.
Not all involve coding; there are plenty of non-programming roles for
eager volunteers.</p>

<p>Below are some of the needs we've identified, but please don't take
these as gospel!  New volunteers bring fresh viewpoints, and one of
the most important things you can do is point out a need we hadn't
recognized before&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;and then fill it.</p>

<div class="h2" id="summer-of-code" title="summer-of-code">
<h2>Google Summer of Code Tasks</h2>

<p>These are the ideas that the Subversion developers have for <a
href="http://code.google.com/soc/">Google Summer of Code</a>
applicants.  These are just some ideas&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;if you have
other ideas, we're happy to consider them too, please just post them
to <a
href="mailto:dev@subversion.tigris.org">dev@subversion.tigris.org</a>.</p>

<p>However, please don't select tasks in the other sections of this
page as your Summer of Code proposal, as those are either not the
right size for the Summer of Code, or are not coding tasks and
therefore not eligible.</p>

<p>You should also read the <a href="hacking.html">Hacker's Guide to
Subversion</a> before starting out on a proposal. Don't hesitate to
ask for details or start discussing one of these tasks on the <a
href="mailto:dev@subversion.tigris.org">dev@subversion.tigris.org</a>
mailing list (see <a
href="http://subversion.tigris.org/servlets/ProjectMailingListList"
>here</a> for subscription information).</p>

<p>In fact, please discuss your task on the mailing list regardless of
whether you've submitted your application yet.  Eagerness to engage
with the rest of the Subversion development community will be
considered favourable in evaluating your application.</p>

<p>If you have questions about the application process, compensation,
or the Google Summer of Code program in general, please see the
program <a

<h3>Allow Commit from multiple working copies</h3>

<p>Currently, 'svn commit' cannot commit changes that are located in
two or more disconnected working copies (lacking a common parent),
even if those working copies belong to the same repository.  This is
a fairly common need for users that work on multiple projects that
are all stored in the same repository and need to commit the changes
for multiple projects in a single atomic commit transaction.</p>

<p>There are several issues in the issue tracker that describe the
problem in more detail (see <a

<h3>Authorization model overhaul</h3>

<p>Subversion's authorization model mostly does the job it was

unnecessary loss of functionality.

<div class="h3" id="viewspecs" title="viewspecs">
<h3>Viewspecs</h3>

<p>Subversion currently supports some mechanisms for selectively
building and populating a working copy, including sparse directory
support and externals definitions.  What Subversion lacks is a handy
way to be told &mdash; in one easy step &mdash; to go off and make use
of those underlying features to build a working copy that looks some
specific way.  Imagine being able to tell new developers on your
project to checkout a working copy using some pre-formulated
specification which results in an automated sparse checkout that
includes your <tt>trunk</tt>, <tt>branches</tt>, and then various
branches for the currently maintained versions of your software
(<tt>branches/<em>SOME-VERSION</em></tt>), instead of having to tell
them to first do a <tt>--depth=empty</tt> checkout of the root, then
a <tt>--set-depth=infinity</tt> update of <tt>trunk</tt>
and <tt>branches</tt>, then &hellip;.</p>

<div class="h3" id="successor-links" title="successor-links">
<h3>Successor links in the versioned filesystem</h3>

<p>Subversion's filesystem backends (BDB and FSFS) currently store in
the nodes of the DAG representation of the versioned filesystem
predecessor references, so for any given node (identified by path and
revision number), you can ask the question, "Which node represents the
previous version of this file or directory?"  What you cannot ask
today is, "Which node(s) represent the <em>next</em> version(s) of
this file or directory?"  (There can be multiple answers because a
given node can be succeeded both by making typical versioned changes
to that file/directory and by copying it elsewhere (via <tt>svn
copy</tt>, e.g.).)  Making the predecessor/successor linkage
bi-directional could be crucial to allowing users to answer questions
like, "Now that I've fixed this bug that was introduced
into <em>SOME-FILE</em> at revision <em>REV</em>, to what other
branches was this version of the file copied (so I can fix the bug in
those places, too)?"</p>

<p>Some work for the Berkeley DB backend was done long ago, and lives

<h3>Integrate the ctypes python bindings into Trac</h3>

<p>Subversion has great new Python bindings, written using ctypes,
but they are not yet used by any major projects. This summer of code
project involves integrating the ctypes python binding into
<a href="http://trac.edgewall.org/">Trac</a>.</p>

<p>This project will consist of the following tasks:</p>

<ul>
   <li>Build redistributable packages for the ctypes bindings that work on
       Windows, Linux, and Mac with Subversion 1.4 or later</li>
   <li>Teach the <a href="http://svn.edgewall.org/repos/trac/trunk/trac/versioncontrol/">Trac
       versioncontrol library</a> to optionally use the ctypes Python bindings</li>
   <li>Test the updated versioncontrol library under high load with Apache and mod_python.
       Fix any bugs you find.</li>
   <li>Convince the <a href="http://trac.edgewall.org/wiki/TracDev">Trac developer community</a>
       to integrate your changes into trunk</li>
</ul>

<p>Students accepted for this task will be granted a branch in the Subversion repository
   for development of related changes, and will be expected to commit at least one change
   or status update per week until the project is complete.</p>

<p>For questions about this project (or feedback on planned proposals), please email
   <a href="mailto:dev@subversion.tigris.org">dev@subversion.tigris.org</a> and CC

<h3>Issue Management</h3>

<p>Do we need an Issue Manager?  Maybe...</p>

<p>The Subversion <a
href="http://subversion.tigris.org/issue-tracker.html">bug
database</a> has been managed in a rather ad hoc fashion thus far.
Periodically we make sweeps over all outstanding issues and try to
prioritize them, organize them into scheduled milestones, note
dependencies between issues, etc.  These methods have been moderately
successful up till now, but they are not scaling well as the number of
issues grows.  Since issue growth is proportional to user base growth,
the issue tracker is becoming a victim of Subversion's success.  We
need to find new ways of managing our issues, ways that do not involve
making O(N) sweeps over the entire list of open issues at regular
intervals.</p>

<p>While we have some semi-formalized management roles (patch manager,
release manager, etc), we have never had an issue manager.  It might
be time to get one, though.  It's not yet clear whether the problem is
mainly one of attention, or of algorithm, or both, but having someone
dedicated to managing the issues database couldn't hurt.  One thing
such a person could do would be to go through the list of outstanding
issues, figure out which ones are likely to be <a
href="#bite-sized">bite-sized tasks</a>, and mark them as such, so
that other volunteers have an easier time choosing things to work on.
We've already marked various issues as bite-sized, but we haven't done
so consistently as new issues come in.  This means there are a lot of
potential entry points to the project going unnoticed.  Want to help
us solve that?</p>

<h3>FAQ Management</h3>

<h2>Bite-Sized Coding Tasks</h2>

<p>The Subversion bug database contains many issues classified as
"bite-sized" tasks&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;tasks that are well-defined and
self-contained, and thus suitable for a volunteer looking to get
involved with the project.  You <i>don't</i> need broad or detailed
knowledge of Subversion's design to take on one of these, just a
pretty good idea of how things generally work, and familiarity with
the coding guidelines in the
<a href="hacking.html">Hacker's Guide to Subversion</a>.  Many tasks
are things a volunteer could pick off in a spare week or two, and
they're a great way to start learning your way around the Subversion
code.</p>

<p> If you start one of these tasks, please notify the other
developers by marking the issue as "STARTED" in the issue tracker,
then mail <a

<div class="h2" id="bindings" title="bindings">
<h2>Improved Bindings to Other Languages</h2>

<p>One of Subversion's strengths is that it offers a rich set of
"binding surfaces": well-documented APIs that are available not only
in C (Subversion's native language) but in other programming languages
as well (see the <a
 href="links.html#lang_bindings">complete list</a>).</p>

<p>Some of these language bindings are maintained via <a
href="http://www.swig.org/">SWIG</a>, a tool that partially automates
the process of generating bindings, while others are maintained by
hand.  Many of the bindings do not have complete coverage yet, or have
interface problems where they do have coverage.  So even though
they're used in many production systems, there's still plenty of work
to do.  Specifically:</p>

<ul>

<li><p>The <a
href="http://svn.collab.net/repos/svn/trunk/subversion/bindings/swig/python/"
>SWIG/Python bindings</a> are in pretty good shape, but their coverage
is not yet complete.  Help is welcome.</p></li>

<li><p>Our <a
href="http://svn.collab.net/repos/svn/trunk/subversion/bindings/java/javahl/"
>Java</a>, <a
href="http://svn.collab.net/repos/svn/trunk/subversion/bindings/swig/perl/"
>SWIG/Perl</a>, and <a
href="http://svn.collab.net/repos/svn/trunk/subversion/bindings/swig/ruby/"
>SWIG/Ruby</a> bindings are in pretty good shape, but maybe there are
other languages you'd like to call Subversion APIs from?  Lisp/Scheme?
Feel free to start a new bindings project, if you don't see what you
need here.</p></li>
