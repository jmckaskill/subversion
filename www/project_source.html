<p>

The Subversion sources are now under revision control in a 
<a href="http://svn.collab.net">Subversion repository</a>.  The CVS
repository is obsolete (you can browse the old CVS ChangeLog online
<a href="http://subversion.tigris.org/cvs-changelog.html">here</a>.)
To obtain Subversion now, you should:

<ol>

   <li>Download a tarball distribution from the <a
   href="http://subversion.tigris.org/servlets/ProjectDownloadList">Downloads
   Page</a>
   </li>
 <p>
   <li>Build and install it according to the instructions in the
   INSTALL file in the top level of the distribution.
   </li>
 <p>
   <li>Use it to check out a working copy of Subversion:
   <p>
   <pre>
      $ svn co http://svn.collab.net/repos/svn
   </pre>
   <p>
   That will get you a new subdirectory named `svn/', with another
   subdirectory in, `svn/trunk/'.  The sources you know and love are
   under `trunk/'.  For now, do the checkout command exactly as given
   above; there's a known path-correspondence bug that will cause you
   some inconvenience in your working copy if your initial checkout is
   of a repository subdir; and another bug if it has a trailing slash.
   These will be fixed as soon as possible; see issues 
   <a href="http://subversion.tigris.org/issues/show_bug.cgi?id=454">#454</a>
   and
   <a href="http://subversion.tigris.org/issues/show_bug.cgi?id=471">#471</a>
   for more information.
   </li>
   <p>
   Some people reported DNS lookup errors for `svn.collab.net'.  The
   IP address is 216.127.237.133, in case you should need it.
 <p>
   <li>
   <pre>
      cd svn/trunk
      svn status
      svn update
      etc, etc, etc...
   </pre>
   </li>
 <p>
   <li>Now you have a working copy.  Most commands work like you
   would expect.  Many of them have bugs, or misconfigured defaults.
   Many features are missing.  Please make sure you're subscribed to
   dev@subversion.tigris.org if you're going to run this.
   </li>
 <p>
   <li>Generally, you should always rebuild and install Subversion
   from your working copy (read the INSTALL and HACKING files).  The
   latest available tarball is still not as recent as an up-to-date
   working copy.  The tarballs are just there to help people
   bootstrap, and (eventually) to provide stability checkpoints.
   </li>
 <p>
   <li>Read the <a
   href="http://subversion.tigris.org/inconveniences.html">Warnings
   and Inconveniences Page</a> for information about some particularly
   annoying bugs and their workarounds.
   </li>

</ul>

To contribute to Subversion:

</p>

<p>
     <ul>

     <li> Join the developer community mailing lists: (see the <a
      href="/project_members.html">Members</a> page.)  </li>

     <li> The Subversion project more-or-less abides by the <a
      href="http://apr.apache.org/guidelines.html">guidelines</a> used
      by the Apache <a href="http://apr.apache.org">APR project</a>.
      Please review these. </li>

     <li> After checking out a copy of the source as described above,
      read the file <b>HACKING</b> at the top of the tree.  It
      describes coding and logging conventions, as well as how to
      build from a working copy.
