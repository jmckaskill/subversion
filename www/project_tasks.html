<p>

Looking for a chance to help out with Subversion?  Then you've come to
the right place...

<p>

This page lists tasks that are well-defined and self-contained.  You
<i>don't</i> need broad or very detailed knowledge of Subversion's
design to take on one of these tasks, you just need a pretty good idea
of how things generally work, and to have read the coding guidelines
in the HACKING file.  The idea is that each task is something that a
volunteer could pick off in a spare evening or two.

<p>

If you'd like to take on one of these tasks, notify the other
developers by mailing dev@subversion.tigris.org (of course, you should
be <a
href="http://subversion.tigris.org/servlets/ProjectMailingListList"
>subscribed</a> to that list) and start coding -- we'll put your name
next to the task here so people can see who's working on what.  If you
have questions as you go, ask the dev list, and send the patch there
when ready.

<p>

Here are the tasks:

<p>

<ul>

   <li> <b>Convert to more appropriate string types throughout code</b> <p>
   This is 
   <a
   href="http://subversion.tigris.org/issues/show_bug.cgi?id=406">issue
   #406</a>.  It involves tweaks across quite a bit of code, but
   they're fairly minor tweaks.  Also, it can be done incrementally,
   there's no particular reason why the whole change needs to happen
   at once.  Estimate: one solid evening, or two at the most.  Here's
   the description:
   <p>
   <pre>
   There are many places where, for historical reasons, we are using
   svn_stringbuf_t to pass or return constant char * data.  We could
   just use svn_string_t, or in some instances even go straight to
   const char *. I will put "### todo" notes, referencing this issue,
   in the code at some of these places. See in particular the
   declarations of
   
      svn_fs_revision_prop()
      svn_fs_revision_proplist()
      svn_fs__get_prop()
      svn_fs__make_prop_hash()
   
   Really, it is questionable that we even need to use svn_string_t
   for property names.  I believe everyone agreed informally that
   const char * would be fine, and usually more convenient for
   callers.  If so, the fix for this issue is something like:
   
      1. Change all property getting functions to take a const char
         *name, and return by reference svn_string_t *value.
   
      2. Change all property setting functions to take const char
         *name and svn_string_t *value.
   
   Comments?  This affects not just svn_fs.h property interfaces, but
   svn_delta_edit_fns_t in svn_delta.h as well, and probably some
   stuff in svn_wc.h.

   Note that making this change probably implies writing
   svn_string_ncreate() and all that good stuff, or else doing it
   inline.  All our old svn_string_* functions became svn_stringbuf_t
   functions when we split the data type, and now there is a paucity
   of svn_string_t functions.
   </pre>
   </li>
   <p>

   <!-- ---------------------------------------------------------- -->

   <li> <b>Add better usage descriptions to subcommand help.</b><p>
   This is
   <a
   href="http://subversion.tigris.org/issues/show_bug.cgi?id=407">issue
   #407</a>, filed by Ben, the description is:
   <p>
   <pre>
   $ svn help co
   checkout (co): Check out a working directory from a repository.
   usage: checkout REPOSPATH1 [REPOSPATH2 REPOSPATH3...]
   
   Notice that there's no mention of the fact that it accepts
   the {-r, -d, -D} flags.  We can either just throw that information
   into the usage command, or perhaps somebody can add an organized
   system for specifying exactly which args a subcommand can accept.
   This system would also be able to *report* which args a subcommand
   can accept -- and thus be used in the usage messages.
   
   This is a "bite sized task" for a volunteer.
   </pre>
   </li>
   <p>

   <!-- ---------------------------------------------------------- -->

   <li> <b>Fix up date parsing library issues</b> <p>
   </li>
   This task is probably small, but will require some investigation
   and list discussion first probably.  The basic issue is this: Ben
   took the getdate.y date grammar file from CVS (that file has always
   been in the public domain) and imported it into Subversion.  So now
   Subversion has CVS's date parsing capabilities, which are good, but
   not perfect.  Aside from the functionality issues, there's also the
   problem that getdate.c needs to be automatically generated from
   getdate.y, and it would be better to have a .c file that we edit
   directly, than a .y file which causes Subversion developers to be
   dependent on having the correct version of Yacc/Bison/Whatever
   installed.
   <p>
   This message from Branko summarizes the issues pretty well; read
   it, then move back and forth in the thread to get some context and
   a sense of what people see as the solution domain right now:

   <a
  href="http://subversion.tigris.org/servlets/ReadMsg?msgId=31147&listName=dev"
   >http://subversion.tigris.org/servlets/ReadMsg?msgId=31147&listName=dev</a>
   <p>

   <!-- ---------------------------------------------------------- -->

   <li> <b>Send usage to stdout or stderr as appropriate</b> <p>
   </li>
   <p>
   This is
   <a
   href="http://subversion.tigris.org/issues/show_bug.cgi?id=402">issue
   #402</a>, the description is:
   <p>
   <pre>
   When user invokes "svn --no-such-option-or-command", the usage
   message should go to stderr, and svn should exit with non-zero exit
   code.  When the user invokes "svn --help", the usage message should
   go to stdout, and svn should exit with zero exit code.

   Not sure how it works now.  Check on this, make it Do The Right Thing.
   </pre>
   <p>
   You can also get much more detailed context about this reading the
   dev list thread whose subject line is "client help messages".  The
   thread starts at this message:
   <p>
   <a
  href="http://subversion.tigris.org/servlets/ReadMsg?msgId=30061&listName=dev"
   >http://subversion.tigris.org/servlets/ReadMsg?msgId=30061&listName=dev</a>
   <p>

   <!-- ---------------------------------------------------------- -->

   <li> <b>Constify svn_parse_date()'s first parameter</b> <p>
   </li>
   This is
   <a
   href="http://subversion.tigris.org/issues/show_bug.cgi?id=408">issue
   #408</a>, the description is:
   <p>
   The first argument of svn_parse_date() should be const.  However,
   because the function originates in getdate.y and that parameter is
   related to the global yyInput variable, there may be more to this
   change than just adding the qualifier...
