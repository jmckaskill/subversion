<h2>What's New in Subversion 1.3</h2>

<ul>
   <li><p>Path-based authorization for svnserve (works similarly to
       mod_authz_svn).</p>

       <p class="todo"><i>TODO: but it needs to be documented.</i></p>
   </li>

   <li><p>Vastly improved bindings to Python: the bound APIs no longer
       require APR pool arguments.  There is also much greater test
       coverage of the Python bindings.</p>

       <p>Users building from a Subversion source tarball do not need
       SWIG at compile-time or run-time.  The Python bindings should
       "just work" now, no SWIG required.  SWIG is only needed by
       tarball packagers and those building Subversion from working
       copy source, in which case it must be SWIG 1.3.24 or 1.3.25.</p>
   </li>

   <li><p>The Apache HTTPD-based server (mod_dav_svn) can now log
       high-level Subversion operations, e.g., "update", "lock",
       "commit", etc.  This feature is turned on or off in the httpd
       configuration file; the default is off.  Equivalent
       functionality is planned for svnserve, the standalone server,
       but not until Subversion 1.4, because the implementation
       strategy there will be a bit different.</p>

       <p class="todo"><i>TODO: file a 1.4 issue for svnserve logging.
       The strategy will be to first create proto-apr-API to write to
       syslodg/win32-eventd.</i></p>
   </li>

   <li><p>Commands that accept peg revisions now operate faster when
       invoked on older pegs. See <a
        href="http://subversion.tigris.org/issues/show_bug.cgi?id=1970"
        >Issue #1970</a> for details.</p>
   </li>

   <li><p>A solution for the ".svn" / "_svn" problem in
       ASP.NET.</p>

       <p class="todo"><i>TODO: Brane has a solution almost done, it's
       sitting in his working copy. <a
     href="http://subversion.tigris.org/servlets/ReadMsg?list=dev&msgNo=105406"
     >http://subversion.tigris.org/servlets/ReadMsg?list=dev&msgNo=105406</a> 
       is the latest message in that thread.</i></p>
   </li>

   <li><p>Interruptable http:// and https:// connections.  If built
   with Neon 0.25.0 or higher, Subversion can be interrupted during
   network operations over http and https.</p>
   </li>

   <li><p class="todo"><i>TODO: need to find out the full story with the
       keywords-as-hash changes</i></p></li>

   <li><p class="todo"><i>TODO: we need to temporarily revert r15287.  See <a 
     href="http://subversion.tigris.org/servlets/ReadMsg?list=dev&msgNo=105738"
     >this mail</a> about it.</i></p></li>

   <li><p class="todo"><i>TODO: need to fix the svn_fs_type() API as
       described in <a
    href="http://subversion.tigris.org/servlets/ReadMsg?list=dev&msgNo=105627"
    >this mail</a>.  Karl Fogel is working on that.</i></p></li>

   <li><p>The usual slew of bugfixes and improved APIs.  See the
       <a href="http://svn.collab.net/repos/svn/trunk/CHANGES"
       >CHANGES</a> file for details.</p>
   </li>
</ul>

<p>Subversion 1.3 is a superset of all previous Subversion releases.
Anything in 1.0.x, 1.1.x, or 1.2.x is also in 1.3, but 1.3 contains
features and bugfixes not present in any earlier release.  The new
features will eventually be documented in a 1.3 version of the free
Subversion book, see
<a href="http://svnbook.red-bean.com">svnbook.red-bean.com</a>.</p>

</div>

<div class="h2" id="downloading" title="downloading">
<h2>Downloading</h2>

<p>Subversion 1.3 is available as source code in three formats:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://subversion.tigris.org/downloads/subversion-1.3.0.tar.gz-NOT-YET"
    >subversion-1.3.0.tar.gz</a></li>
<li><a href="http://subversion.tigris.org/downloads/subversion-1.3.0.tar.bz2-NOT-YET"
    >subversion-1.3.0.tar.bz2</a></li>
<li><a href="http://subversion.tigris.org/downloads/subversion-1.3.0.zip-NOT-YET"
    >subversion-1.3.0.zip</a>&nbsp;(Windows)</li>
</ul>

<p>For binary packages, please see <a
href="project_packages.html#binary-packages">the binary package
list</a>.  Note that binary packages usually come out about a week
after the corresponding source release.  The package maintainers are
volunteers, so please don't harass them&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;they know
when a new source release has come out, and they work as fast as they
can to make binaries available.</p>

<p>For other Subversion releases, see <a
href="http://subversion.tigris.org/servlets/ProjectDocumentList?folderID=260&amp;expandFolder=74"
>this folder</a>.</p>

<div class="h2" id="compatibility" title="compatibility">
<h2>Compatibility Concerns</h2>

<p>Older clients and servers interoperate transparently with 1.3
servers and clients.  Of course, some of the new 1.3 features may not
be available unless both client and server are the latest version.
There is <strong>no need</strong> to upgrade your repositories;
Subversion 1.3 can read repositories created by earlier versions.  To
upgrade an existing installation, just install the newest libraries
and binaries on top of the older ones. (<em>WARNING:</em> if you're
using Berkeley DB repositories, installing a new binary distribution
of Subversion may force you to upgrade Berkeley DB as well, see
<a href="#bdb-upgrade">Unexpected Berkeley DB Upgrades</a> below.)</p>

<p>Subversion 1.3 maintains API/ABI compatibility with earlier
releases, by only adding new functions.  A program written to the 1.0,
1.1, or 1.2 API can both compile and run using 1.3 libraries.
However, a program written for 1.3 cannot necessarily compile or run
against older libraries.</p>

<div class="h3" id="output-changes" title="output-changes">
<h3>Command Line Output Changes</h3>

<p>Although the Subversion developers try hard to keep output from the
command line programs compatible between releases, new information
sometimes has to be added.  This might break scripts that rely on the
exact format of the output.  In 1.3, the following changes have been
made to the output:</p>

<ul>
<li><p class="todo"><i>TODO: I don't think we actually have any this
    time, do we?</i></p></li>
</ul>

</div>

<div class="h3" id="bdb-upgrade" title="bdb-upgrade">
<h3>Unexpected Berkeley DB Upgrades</h3>

<p>This is not actually related to the Subversion 1.3 release, but it
may affect you if you upgrade to 1.3 via a package distribution
system.</p>

<p>A lot of operating systems now ship Berkeley DB 4.3.  Sometimes the
system Berkeley DB libraries can be unintentionally upgraded to 4.3 as
part of some other change pulled down via an OS package delivery
mechanism&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;for example, upgrading one's Subversion
package.  If this happens to you, you will need
to <a href="faq.html#bdb43-upgrade">upgrade existing BerkeleyDB-based
repositories to 4.3.</a></p>

<p>Since Subversion 1.2, the <a
href="http://subversion.tigris.org/servlets/ProjectDocumentList?folderID=91"
>Windows binary distributions</a> of Subversion from Branko &#268;ibej
use Berkeley DB 4.3.  If you are upgrading from an older version, the
above may be of concern to you.</p>

</div>

<div class="h2" id="svn-1.1-deprecation" title="svn-1.1-deprecation">
<h2>Deprecation of 1.1.x Series</h2>

<p class="todo"><i>TODO: We need to decide whether we want to do this.</i></p>

<p>The Subversion 1.1.x line is no longer supported.  This doesn't
mean that your 1.1 installation is doomed; if it works well and is all
you need, that's fine.  "No longer supported" just means we've stopped
accepting bug reports against 1.1.x versions, and will not make any
more 1.1.x bugfix releases (except perhaps for a critical security or
data-loss bug.)</p>
