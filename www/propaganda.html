<h3>Testimonials</h3>

    <strong><a
    href="http://subversion.tigris.org/servlets/ReadMsg?list=users&msgNo=10651"
          >Post from Stuart Robertson of Absolute Systems,
          Inc</a></strong> <br/>
 
      <em><p>I introduced SVN to Absolute Systems Inc.
      (www.absolutesys.com) where I work about a year ago, and for
      about 8 months we ran internal SVN pilots, played around to gain
      experience and trust, etc.</p>

      <p>In the last 4 months we have migrated all of our internal
      product source repositories from Visual Source-Safe to SVN using
      an internally-written VSS-to-SVN migration tool.</p>

      <p>Our largest SVN repository is now 3.7GB and currently has
      68806 revisions. We are running SVN 1.0.1 + Apache 2.0.48 on
      Linux. ...</p>

      <p>SVN is a superb piece of work, and it is a *huge* step
      forward from VSS.  To put things in perspective... previously we
      had 26 VSS databases for one product, primarily because of
      problems with VSS when the repositories grow large.  As you can
      imagine, trying to manage product releases across so many
      repositories was really painful.<p>

      <p>Now, with SVN, *all* of the artifacts for that same product are
      in a single repository, meaning that with a few cheap copy
      operations all of the sources that make up a given release can
      be grouped together. ...</p></em>

    >Post from Sebastien Cevey</a></strong> <br/>
 
      <em><p>... I've been using Subversion for personnal and team
      projects for a few years now.  I never regretted it, except for
      the deep frustration I feel everytime I have to go back to CVS.</p>

      <p>I am glad to have introduced many people to this software,
      through projects, talks or a course on versionning systems.  I
      haven't heard anybody disappointed by it, and this doesn't
      surprise me. ...</p></em>

         "culley", OS news article</a></strong> <br/>
 
      <em>I recently evaluated both subversion and arch and chose
          subversion for my company. Probably the number 1 reason was
          the subversion book-- arch is not documented as well as
          subversion. All I want a centralized repository where me and
          2-3 other developers can collaborate. I don't want to push
          the envelope on version control-- the existing models work
          great for me and 99% of the open source projects out
          there. I don't need to create branches while on an air
          plane. I do need to easily move files around in my
          repository. Subversion it is!</em>

      <em>... Then we discovered Subversion. Our concerns about the
          stability and maturity of SVN (since it was a 0.24 version
          back then) soon faded away and about two weeks ago we
          decided to port ALL of our projects into Subversion
