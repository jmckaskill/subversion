    href="http://subversion.tigris.org/servlets/ReadMsg?list=users&msgNo=10651"
          >Post from Stuart Robertson of Absolute Systems,
          Inc</a></strong>
          <tt>(5&nbsp;May&nbsp;2004)</tt>
          <br/>
 
      <em><p>I introduced SVN to Absolute Systems Inc.
      (www.absolutesys.com) where I work about a year ago, and for
      about 8 months we ran internal SVN pilots, played around to gain
      experience and trust, etc.</p>

      <p>In the last 4 months we have migrated all of our internal
      product source repositories from Visual Source-Safe to SVN using
      an internally-written VSS-to-SVN migration tool.</p>

      <p>Our largest SVN repository is now 3.7GB and currently has
      68806 revisions. We are running SVN 1.0.1 + Apache 2.0.48 on
      Linux. ...</p>

      <p>SVN is a superb piece of work, and it is a *huge* step
      forward from VSS.  To put things in perspective... previously we
      had 26 VSS databases for one product, primarily because of
      problems with VSS when the repositories grow large.  As you can
      imagine, trying to manage product releases across so many
      repositories was really painful.<p>

      <p>Now, with SVN, *all* of the artifacts for that same product are
      in a single repository, meaning that with a few cheap copy
      operations all of the sources that make up a given release can
      be grouped together. ...</p></em>

      <em><p>I'm sure you are aware about the fantastic product you
      people have built, but I'd like to tell you a little story which
      should give new users some comfort about it.

      <p>Here in Conectiva we used to maintain our packages in a file
      based system, storing the latest SRPM packages, and also some
      old versions in case something bad happened. For a long time we
      wanted to build some system which would make our life easier in
      the daily work, and at the same time would give us some
      flexibility accessing historic information.</p>

      <p>Shortening the history a lot, 1 year and 6 months ago, the
      first revision was committed into our repository:</p></em>

      Created basic structure.
      ------------------------------------------------------------------------
      </pre>

      <em><p>Since then, 5 complete Conectiva Linux distributions were
      committed into the repository, and every single update in the
      distribution is done using Subversion. We've already surpassed
      50000 revisions, in a 30GB repository. Even though we have had
      space, memory, and other kinds of problems around the
      repository, I'm proud to say we have never lost a single bit of
      information since then.</p>

      <p>Based on this, the least I could do is sending a big THANK
      YOU for everyone involved in the project.</p></em>

      <em><p>We are using Subversion since version 0.17 and it never
      let us down.  On contrary it provided a much better experience
      than any versioning system we have used before, including CVS
      and perforce. With Apple adding support for .svn files within
      NIBs with Xcode 1.2 we are certain that subversion is the ideal
      versioning platform for modern software development on Mac OS
      X.</em><tt></tt></p>

      <em><p>... We're moving from CVSNT to Subversion this week. I
       beat the crap out of it, and it's just amazing source
       control. Every CVS weakness that I ever complained about is
       gone, and the "changeset" concept has resulted in significantly
       easier to understand commits, and much better performance
       updates. ... </em><tt>(from Brad Wilson)</tt></p>

      <p>Happy subversion user here. ... I *love* that moves and
      renames are tracked correctly and update working copies
      sensibly.  Atomic commits are one of those features where even
      if you don't really get it when you read it on the feature list,
      once you're used to having it you can't imagine life without
      it. ... </em><tt>(from Ian Olsen)</tt> </p></em>

    <tt>(27&nbsp;February&nbsp;2004)</tt> <br/>

      <em><p>I've probably used the vast majority of mainstream
      version control systems including CVS, SCCS, RCS, Perforce,
      PVCS, Rational ClearCase, Microsoft Visual SourceSafe, and
      others.  While none of these are perfect, and Subversion, while
      feature-rich, isn't fully perfect, my brief use of Subversion
      has elevated it to the top of my list and has lead me to
      seriously consider dropping CVS in favor of Subversion for my
      personal projects.  Of all of the modern batch of version
      control systems, I think that Perforce is great, but I think
      that Subversion is better, especially when used with
      TortoiseSVN.  Subversion edges out Perforce because of the price
      (free) and it beats the pants off of ClearCase, basically
      because it works.  I've had good and rocky times with open
      source software, but the group of people behind Subversion and
      TortoiseSVN have done an excellent job building a quality
      product and should be very proud of themselves.  With version
      1.0, I see Subversion becoming a major player and I think that
      within the next year we'll start to see a mass migration from
      CVS to Subversion.  I also see (or at least hope) that the
      version control marketplace takes notice because Subversion will
      give them a run for their money.  It's going to be harder to
      make the sale and justify spending thousands of dollars for a
      difficult-to-use version control system when there's a free and
      open source version control system that is plainly better than
      the commercial competition.</p></em>

      the deep frustration I feel everytime I have to go back to CVS.</p>

      <p>I am glad to have introduced many people to this software,
      through projects, talks or a course on versionning systems.  I
      haven't heard anybody disappointed by it, and this doesn't
      surprise me. ...</p></em>

      <em>I recently evaluated both subversion and arch and chose
          subversion for my company. Probably the number 1 reason was
          the subversion book-- arch is not documented as well as
          subversion. All I want a centralized repository where me and
          2-3 other developers can collaborate. I don't want to push
          the envelope on version control-- the existing models work
          great for me and 99% of the open source projects out
          there. I don't need to create branches while on an air
          plane. I do need to easily move files around in my
          repository. Subversion it is!</em>
