          >Ron Bieber</a></strong>
          <tt>(23&nbsp;July&nbsp;2004)</tt>
          <br/>
 
      <em><p>I currently manage a group of about 20 developers for a
          Fortune 500 company.  We used CVS from January of 2001 until
          May of 2004 when we converted all of our repositories over
          to Subversion.</p>

      <p>The advantages we received from Subversion are immense.
      Before our conversion to CVS from VSS, we had two full time
      employees managing our production builds.  Upon conversion to
      CVS we cut that resource count down to one.  This resource
      handled all branching and merging activities, reporting
      activities, and manipulation of the CVS repository to move files
      while retaining history.  The CVS branching and merging was just
      too cryptic (and took too long) for anyone to want to learn it.
      We had two CVS "experts" in house which included me and one of
      my direct reports.  We were constantly called in to resolve
      issues.  I myself spent a ton of time managing the support of
      the CVS repositories.</p>

      <p>After running across Subversion by chance in May of 2003, I
      started piloting it at home.  As I used it more, I became
      convinced that this was a tool that my team needed in order to
      increase our productivity.  After using it for a while, I was
      able to come up with some specific areas that justified our
      conversion to Subversion in order to maximize our productivity
      and code quality:</p>

      <ol>

        <li>Atomic commits - The lack of atomicity in commits was a
        huge problem for us with CVS.  Subversion gives us the
        confidence that when we commit, everything went into the
        repository.</li>

        <li>The ability to back out changes before going to
        production--using an activity branching model, we can allow
        developers to branch per activity and only merge to the main
        source base after code reviews have been performed.  If there
        are problems, we have one revision we can back out that
        includes the full changeset for that change. While the
        repository level revisioning was a shift for my developers to
        make that didn't happen immediately, it begins to make sense
        when an activity had to be removed from the build.  In CVS we
        had to go through each file looking for revisions that were
        effected by a change.  Subversion now manages this for
        us.</li>

        <li>Decreased build time.  We run CruiseControl, and the
        checkout times we were experiencing with CVS, along with our
        requirement to tag of our source base after each build caused
        our automated build cycle to take an inordinate amount of
        time.  With the restriction that all production changes MUST
        go through the build, this made emergency situations very
        stressful.  The cheap copy functionality of Subversion
        decreased the time it took to get a change into source
        control, through the build system, and into deployment
        packages by 80%, greatly increasing our response time.</li>

        <li>Directory Versioning - this was a big deal that caused us
        to actually evaluate Clearcase at one point.  The CVS Attic
        was killing us in checkout time and build time with the
        velocity of change we were making to the source base.  When
        checkout times got too slow, we would have to wipe out the
        attic, effectively wiping out the history of our source base.
        With Subversion, we can remove something from the repository
        and not suffer performance penalties later (and still be able
        to get the deleted contents back).</li>

        <li>Simpler (and faster) branching - we no longer have a full
        time FTE managing branches.  We are now cycling this activity
        through the group.  Each developer can perform this activity,
        because it is now part of his daily work.</li>
      </ol>

      <p>As a manager, converting to Subversion was one of the best
      decisions I have made thus far that had a such a direct and
      highly visible impact on the productivity of my team.</p>

      <p>I hope this helps you make your case for Subversion.  My
      personal opinion is that no one should even consider CVS at this
      point in time.  Subversion is a great product and the support
      you get just on the mailing lists alone (from the development
      team no less!) is second to none.</p></em>

    <em><p>For my own company Controlling Edge and at one of my
        customers S4 Technology (www.s4-technology.com) I have been
        running subversion since 0.17 and have never looked
        back. While there were a few issues initially we have never
        lost anything and currently have around 20 repositories
        containing everything from source code, documentation to
        complete product installations. We use subversion to install
        and upgrade the software on our servers. Once we copy the svn
        client onto the box the entire installation is a simple svn co
        plus the asvn to restore symlinks, devices and file
        permissions. Upgrading between releases with svn is great as
        it automatically merges any changes to local configuration
        files with new entries for the latest version. We even use svn
        to store file system images for our embedded devices (linux
        file system). Currently we have to check out the svn image on
        a server and then downloaded to our embedded device via
        rsync. We don't have the memory for a full svn client nor the
        disk space for the working copy but one day we will write our
        own svn client that can just do the checkout without the need
        for the wc support files or the memory overhead.</p>

    <p>For the past 9 years I had been installing CVS at customer
    sites that required version control and wouldn't hesitate now to
    recommend SVN instead.</p></em>

    <em><p>I work for a government contracting facility.  We develop
        everything from hardware, to full-fledged software
        applications, all of which supports mission-critical
        activities.  We're currently using it on one of our most
        productive teams, and houses about 3 years worth of work (for
        about 14 developers).  We started off with CVS, and found that
        the customer was constantly coming back with request for
        features and upgrades.  Our small test projects would turn
        into fully-funded applications, and as such, we had to
        restructure them.  It was just too painful with CVS, and we
        decided to look for something better.</p>

    <p>We found Subversion when it was at version 0.17.  We started
    with just a few developers using it, and then migrated our other
    developers over time.  I can say without question that it has been
    one of the best decisions that we've made.  Subversion works
    better than CVS ever did.  We can detect corruption before it gets
    to be a problem, we get atomic commits, and directory versioning.
    All of which has made our development process and our ability to
    adapt to the customers' ever-changing requirements that much
    easier.  Plus, it natively supports both the Windows and Linux
    platforms (versus the mixing of CVS and CVSNT that we had before),
    which is our primary development platforms.  We've never lost any
    data, and our developers have found it to be a very intuitive
    tool.  Subversion has been rock-solid in our environment, and very
    much complements our software engineering practices.  I can't
    speak highly enough of it.</p></em>

      <em><p>I introduced SVN to Absolute Systems Inc.
      (www.absolutesys.com) where I work about a year ago, and for
      about 8 months we ran internal SVN pilots, played around to gain
      experience and trust, etc.</p>

      <p>In the last 4 months we have migrated all of our internal
      product source repositories from Visual Source-Safe to SVN using
      an internally-written VSS-to-SVN migration tool.</p>

      <p>Our largest SVN repository is now 3.7GB and currently has
      68806 revisions. We are running SVN 1.0.1 + Apache 2.0.48 on
      Linux. ...</p>

      <p>SVN is a superb piece of work, and it is a *huge* step
      forward from VSS.  To put things in perspective... previously we
      had 26 VSS databases for one product, primarily because of
      problems with VSS when the repositories grow large.  As you can
      imagine, trying to manage product releases across so many
      repositories was really painful.<p>

      <p>Now, with SVN, *all* of the artifacts for that same product are
      in a single repository, meaning that with a few cheap copy
      operations all of the sources that make up a given release can
      be grouped together. ...</p></em>

      flexibility accessing historic information.</p>

      <em><p>Since then, 5 complete Conectiva Linux distributions were

      distribution is done using Subversion. We've already surpassed
      50000 revisions, in a 30GB repository. Even though we have had

      attribute part of the productivity gains we have see in the past

    painful (we are a Unix shop).</p>

    <p>Since we switched to subversion things have been much better.
    Our entire history was transported into our Subversion repository,
    so none of our history was lost.  I wrote a Python script to
    transform it directly from SCCS to Subversion, and it was
    painless.</p>

    <p>Conflicts have been very rare.  The ability to easily branch
    has been very useful; developers can make commits to branches
    without breaking other people's code.  It's easier to see what
    people are working on as the commits hit our internal commit
    mailing list.  Since we tag each release, we're able to determine
    which source code contributed to a release.  TortiseSVN makes
    Windows development easy (no more ftping files over, or trying to
    build on a remotely mounted samba drive).</p>

    <p>I also have had a very positive experience moving from CVS to
    Subversion in a commercial setting.  We are a small-ish silicon
    valley startup that used to have everything in CVS.  Shortly after
    I joined as s/w manager I switched the s/w team to SVN (0.37) with
    excellent results.  We have had zero loss of data, zero down time,
    with effective branching, easy repository restructuring and
    constant time tags as our big positives.  The entire company will
    be moving in the near-ish future based on our pilot.  And of
    course the support from this list is fantastic.</p>

    wish-list portion of Chris's testimonial...]</font></p>

    <p>As for my wishlist, it is short - completely seamless and
    foolproof tracking of merge history at the same level as the
    commercial tools.  I don't want to remember revision numbers, I
    just want to branch and merge with the tool remembering common
    base versions etc.  This is really the only thing I miss about
    ClearCase.</p>

    <p><font color="red">[We agree :-).  Better merge tracking is on
    Subversion's long-term roadmap.]</font></p>

      <em><p>We are using Subversion since version 0.17 and it never
      let us down.  On contrary it provided a much better experience
      than any versioning system we have used before, including CVS
      and perforce. With Apple adding support for .svn files within
      NIBs with Xcode 1.2 we are certain that subversion is the ideal
      versioning platform for modern software development on Mac OS
      X.</p></em>

      <em><p>I've probably used the vast majority of mainstream
      version control systems including CVS, SCCS, RCS, Perforce,
      PVCS, Rational ClearCase, Microsoft Visual SourceSafe, and
      others.  While none of these are perfect, and Subversion, while
      feature-rich, isn't fully perfect, my brief use of Subversion
      has elevated it to the top of my list and has lead me to
      seriously consider dropping CVS in favor of Subversion for my
      personal projects.  Of all of the modern batch of version
      control systems, I think that Perforce is great, but I think
      that Subversion is better, especially when used with
      TortoiseSVN.  Subversion edges out Perforce because of the price
      (free) and it beats the pants off of ClearCase, basically
      because it works.  I've had good and rocky times with open
      source software, but the group of people behind Subversion and
      TortoiseSVN have done an excellent job building a quality
      product and should be very proud of themselves.  With version
      1.0, I see Subversion becoming a major player and I think that
      within the next year we'll start to see a mass migration from
      CVS to Subversion.  I also see (or at least hope) that the
      version control marketplace takes notice because Subversion will
      give them a run for their money.  It's going to be harder to
      make the sale and justify spending thousands of dollars for a
      difficult-to-use version control system when there's a free and
      open source version control system that is plainly better than
      the commercial competition.</p></em>

      <em><p>... I've been using Subversion for personal and team
      projects for a few years now.  I never regretted it, except for
      the deep frustration I feel everytime I have to go back to CVS.</p>

      <p>I am glad to have introduced many people to this software,
      through projects, talks or a course on versionning systems.  I
      haven't heard anybody disappointed by it, and this doesn't
      surprise me. ...</p></em>

      <em>I recently evaluated both subversion and arch and chose
          subversion for my company. Probably the number 1 reason was
          the subversion book-- arch is not documented as well as
          subversion. All I want a centralized repository where me and
          2-3 other developers can collaborate. I don't want to push
          the envelope on version control-- the existing models work
          great for me and 99% of the open source projects out
          there. I don't need to create branches while on an air
          plane. I do need to easily move files around in my
          repository. Subversion it is!</em>
