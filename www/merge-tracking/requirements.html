of which are driven by Subversion's <a

users.  A few outliers are driven by <a

<h3>Merging</h3>

<div class="h4" id="repeated-merge">
<h4>Repeated Merge</h4>

<p>Track which changesets have been applied where, so users can
repeatedly merge branch A to branch B without having to remember the
last range of revisions ported.  This would also track changeset <a
href="#cherry-picking">cherry picking</a> done by users, so we don't
accidentally re-merge changesets that are already applied.  This is
the problem that <a href="http://svk.elixus.org/">svk</a> and <a
href="http://www.gnu.org/software/gnu-arch/">arch</a> claim to have
already solved, what they're calling <em>star-merge</em>.</p>

</div>  <!-- repeated-merge -->

<div class="h4" id="cherry-picking">
<h4>Cherry Picking</h4>

<p>Merge of one or more individual changes from branch A into branch
B.  This sometimes involves manual application of the changes from rN
in branch A (e.g. not using <code>svn merge</code>), or manual
adjustment of a change merged into a WC before it's committed to the
repository.  Regardless of the merge method used, Subversion must
provide a way to indicate that the change(s) have been merged into
branch B.</p>

<p>Additionally, it's important to be able to cherry pick changes in
multiple different directions.  For example, if you create a release
branch B by copying the trunk you should be able to both forward port
changes made on B into trunk and backport changes made on trunk into B
without confusing the merge tracking algorithm.</p>

</div>  <!-- cherry picking -->


<div class="h4" id="rename-tracking">
<h4>Track Renames in Merge</h4>

<p><code>svn merge</code> needs to handle renames better.  This
requires <a
href="http://subversion.tigris.org/issues/show_bug.cgi?id=898">true
rename support</a>.</p>

<p>Edit foo.c on branch A.  Rename foo.c to bar.c on branch B.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Try merging the branch A edit into a working copy of branchB:
  <code>svn merge</code> will skip the file, because it can't find
  it.</li>

  <li>Conversely, try merging branch B rename to branch A: <code>svn
  merge</code> will delete the 'newer' version of foo.c and add bar.c,
  which has the older text.</li>
</ol>

<p>Problem #2 stems from the fact that we don't have <a
href="http://subversion.tigris.org/issues/show_bug.cgi?id=898">true
renames</a>, just copies (with history) and deletes.  That's not
fixable without a FS schema change, and (probably) a libsvn_wc
rewrite.</p>

<p>It's not clear what it would take to solve problem #1.  See <a
href="http://www.contactor.se/~dast/svn/archive-2004-07/0084.shtml">the
discussion</a> about our rename woes, and the relationship to merge
tracking.</p>

</div>  <!-- rename-tracking -->

<div class="h4" id="merge-previews">
<h4>Merge Previews</h4>

<p>Merge previews are dry runs that show conflicts and "non-trivial,
non-conflicting" (NTNC) changes in advance.  These previews should be
exportable and parseable.  (From the <a href="summit.html#merge-previews" 
>distributable resolution item</a> in the summit summary).</p>

</div>  <!-- merge-previews -->

<div class="h4" id="automated-merge">
<h4>SCM Automated Merge</h4>

<p>The ability to automate merges (e.g. from a stable branch to a
development branch), including interfaces for resolving conflicts and
handling other errors, is important.  <a
href="../user-classifications.html#merge-meister">Merge Meisters</a>
who do multi-thousand file merges stress this.</p>

</div>  <!-- automated-merge -->

<div class="h4" id="distributable-resolution">
<h4>Distributability of Merge Resolution</h4>

<p>The mechanism for resolving conflicts in a merge should be
distributable across N developers.  Meeting this requirement might
mean a departure for Subversion, since it implies that merge results
are not just stored in one working copy, but are somehow available on
the server side.  (From the <a href="summit.html#distributable-resolution"
>distributable resolution item</a> in the summit summary).</p>

</div>  <!-- distributable-resolution -->

</div>  <!-- merging -->


<div class="h3" id="auditing">
<h3>Auditing</h3>

<p>Merge tracking must be audit-friendly, supporting some basic forms
of reporting which allow for discovery of following types of
information:</p>

<ul>
  <li>If you merge rN into some destination (e.g. branch B), it should
  be possible to query rN itself to ask what destinations it has been
  merged to, and the answer set should contain B.</li>

  <li>If you merge rN into a branch B, and rN was committed by author A,
  then <code>svn blame</code> should show the changed lines in B as
  last touched by A, even if the merge was committed by you and you
  are not A.  This must also work when merging a range of revisions
  with different authors.</li>

  <li>If you merge rN into a branch B, and rN was committed by author
  A, then <code>svn log -rN</code> should show both the original
  author A, <em>and</em> the author who merged the change.</li>

  <li>It should be possible to query any path (file, directory, or
  symlink) to find out what changes (revisions) have been merged under
  it.  For files, "under" just means "into".</li>

  <li>It should be easy to discover all the paths at which a particular
  node revision (i.e., unique versioned file entity) exists,
  especially in a given revision.  In other words, this is the "what
  branches does this exact version of this file exist in" problem,
  often requested by so-called enterprise-level users.</li>

  <li>Merge records should be transitive.  Often we merge a bunch of
  changes to a backport branch, tweak them there, then later merge the
  branch into a release line.  Later queries of the release line
  should show that the original revisions are present, and queries
  of the original revisions should show that they went to the release
  line as well as the backport branch.</li>
</ul>

<div class="h3" id="misc">
<h3>Miscellaneous</h3>

<div class="h4" id="dump-load">
<h4>Allow for Dump/Load</h4>

<p>Whatever solution is chosen must play well with <code>svnadmin
dump</code> and <code>svnadmin load</code>.  For example, the metadata
used to store merge tracking history must not be stored in terms of
some filesystem backend implementation detail (e.g.
"node-revision-ids") unless, perhaps, those IDs are present for all
items in the dump as a sort of "soft data" (which would allow them to
be used for "translating" the merge tracking data at load time, where
those IDs would be otherwise irrelevant).  See <a
href="http://subversion.tigris.org/issues/show_bug.cgi?id=1525">issue
1525</a> about user-visible entity IDs.</p>

</div>  <!-- dump-load -->

<div class="h4" id="common-case-ease">
<h4>User Interface Ease in Common Cases</h4>

(This was one of the points made at
the <a
href="http://svn.collab.net/repos/svn/trunk/notes/EuroOSCON-2005-vc-bof.txt"
>EuroOSCON 2005 Version Control BOF session</a>.)

<p>The interface for common-case merges should be easy.  Currently it
is not.  For example, a very common case is merging all previously
unmerged changes from trunk to branch (more formally, from a source
line to a descendant destination line).  Today, one must type
<code>svn&nbsp;merge&nbsp;-rX:Y&nbsp;URL&nbsp;WC</code>.  But why
can't the dest just remember what has been merged from that src before
and do the right thing?  Then one could type
<code>svn&nbsp;merge&nbsp;SRC&nbsp;DST</code>.  Or better yet,
branches could remember where they come from, and one could just type
<code>svn&nbsp;merge&nbsp;SRC</code>, or
<code>svn&nbsp;merge&nbsp;DST</code>, depending on whether one wants a
push or pull interface.  (It was pointed out that SVK does remember
these things; if someone familiar with the SVK interface wants to put
an example transcript here, that would be great.)</p>

<p>Here is the svk command transcript:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
A branch creation by:
<code>svk copy //project/trunk //project/branch-B</code>
(or mirroring an existing subversion repository containing such branch)
</p>

<p>
To merge from trunk to branch-B:
<code>svk smerge //project/trunk //project/branch-B</code>, or
<code>svk smerge --to //project/branch-B</code>, or
<code>svk pull //project/branch-B</code>
</p>
<p>
To merge from branch-B back to trunk:
<code>svk smerge //project/trunk //project/branch-B</code>, or
<code>svk smerge --from //project/branch-B</code>, or
<code>svk push //project/branch-B</code>
</p>

<p>
There is also a <code>-I</code> flag in smerge to merge changes
revision-by-revision.  Push is by default with the option, and
pull is not.
</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Another common case is porting a single change from one line to
another.  This currently requires <code>-r&lt;X-1&gt;:X</code> syntax,
but Subversion 1.4 will include the <code>-c</code> option (introduced
in <a href="http://svn.collab.net/viewvc/svn?rev=17054&amp;view=rev"
>r17054</a>), so users will no longer need to perform this menial
arithmetic.  However, Subversion 1.4 will still require the URL of the
merge source to be specified; a merge tracking solution that eases
common cases would obviate the need for the user to supply the URL
when a single change is ported from a branch's ancestor line.</p>

<p>svk merge also supports <code>-c N</code> flag which is
<code>-rN-1:N</code>.</p>
