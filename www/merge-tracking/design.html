<p>Subversion's <a href="index.html">merge tracking</a> uses a layered
design, with the user-visible operations based primarily on the
information from the <a href="#merge-history">merge history</a>.</p>

<h2>Merge History</h2>

<p>Or, <em>Tracking What Revisions Have Been Merged Where</em>
provides the information used by Subversion's merge tracking-related
capabilities (history sensitive merging, etc.).  The design is based
on Dan Berlin's <a
href="http://svn.haxx.se/dev/archive-2006-04/0916.shtml">proposal</a>
<small>(Message-Id:
&lt;1146242044.23718.1.camel@dberlin0-corp.corp.google.com&gt;)</small>.</p>

<p style="color: red">The following content has been temporarily
superseded by <a
href="http://svn.collab.net/repos/svn/trunk/notes/merge-tracking.txt">notes
on the development branch</a>, which contain some changes not listed
in this section.</p>

<div class="h3">
<h3>Goals</h3>

<p>The goal of the Merge History portion of the design is to track the
information needed by the operations outlined by the <a
href="requirements.html">use cases</a> (e.g. the revision numbers
being merged by a merge operation), and keeping this information in
the right places as various operations (<code>copy</code>,
<code>delete</code>, <code>add</code>, etc.) are performed.  This
portion of the design does <em>not</em> encompass the operations
themselves.</p>

<p>The goals:</p>

<ul>
  <li>To be able to track this down to what files in a working copy
  and be able to determine what files have had what revisions merged
  into them.</li>

  <li>To not need to contact the server more than we already do now to
  determine which revisions have been merged in a file or directory
  (ie some contact is acceptable, asking the server about each file is
  not).</li>

  <li>To be able to edit merge information in a human editable
  form.</li>

  <li>For the information to be stored in a space efficient manner,
  and to be able to determine the revisions merged into a given
  file/director in a time efficient manner.</li>

  <li>Still getting a conservatively correct answer (not worse than
  what we have now) when no merge info is specified.</li>

  <li>To be able to collect, transmit, and keep this information up to
  date as much as possible on the client side.</li>

  <li>To be able to index this information in the future order to
  answer queries.</li>
</ul>

<p><em>Pre-notes:</em> Whether to store info in revprops, or just on
dirs and files, is still an open question.  It makes certain semantics
clearer on what operations do below and how to proceed easier.  The
question is whether it is efficient enough time wise when we go to
retrieve merge info, and whether it complicates what merge has to do
too much.  It also removes all of the listed <a
href="#merge-history-prereqs">prerequisites</a>.</p>

</div>  <!-- goals -->

<div class="h3" id="storage">
<h3>Information Storage</h3>

<p>The first question that many people ask is "where should we store
the merge information?" (what we store will be covered next).  A merge
history property, named <code>SVN_MERGE_PROPERTY</code>
(e.g. <code>svn:mergeinfo</code>) stored in the revision properties,
directory properties, and file properties.  Each will store the
<em>full</em>, <em>complete</em> list of current merged in changes, as
far as it knows.  This ensures that the merge algorithm and other
consumers do not have to walk back revisions in order to get the
transitive closure of the revision list.</p>

<p>The way we choose which of file, dir, revprop merge info to use in
case of conflicts simple system of inheritance <a
href="#merge-history-footnotes">[1]</a> where the "most specific"
place wins.  This means that if the property is set on a file, that
completely overrides the directory and revision level properties.</p>

<p>The way we choose which to store to depends on how much and where
you merge, and will be covered in the semantics.</p>

<p>The reasoning for this system is to avoid having to either copy
info everywhere, or crawl everywhere, in order to determine which
revisions have been applied.  At the same time, we want to be space
and time efficient, so we can't just store the entire revision list
everywhere.</p>

<p>As for what is stored:</p>

<p>A survey of the community shows a slight preference for a human
editable storage format along the lines of how svnmerge stores its
merge info (e.g. path name and list of revisions).  Binary storage of
such information would buy, on average, a 2-3 byte decrease per
revision/range in size over ASCII <a
href="merge-history-footnotes">[2]</a>, while making it not directly
human readable/editable.</p>

<p>The revisions we have merged <em>into</em> something are
represented as a path, a colon, and then a comma separated revision
list, containing one or more revision or revision ranges.  Revision
range end and beginning points are separated by "-".</p>

<div class="h4" id="merge-info-grammar">
<h4>Grammar</h4>
<table>
<tr>
  <th align="left">Token</th>
  <th align="left">Definition</th>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>revisionrange</td>
  <td>REVISION "-" REVISION</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>revisioneelement</td>
  <td>revisionrange | REVISION</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>revisionlist</td>
  <td>revisioneelement (COMMA revisioneelement)*</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>revisionline</td>
  <td>PATHNAME COLON revisionlist</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>top</td>
  <td>revisionline (NEWLINE revisionline)*</td>
</tr>
</table>
</div>  <!-- merge-info-grammar -->

<p>This list will <em>not</em> be stored in a canonicalized minimal
form for a path (e.g. it may contain single revision numbers that
could fall into ranges).  This is chiefly because the benefit of such
a canonical format (slightly easier for <em>comparison</em>, but not
indexing) is outweighed by the fact that generating a canonical form
may require groveling through a lot of information to determine what
that minimal canonical form is.  In particular, it may be that the
revision list "5,7,9" is, in minimal canonical form, "5-9", because 6
and 8 do not have any affect on the path name that 5 and 9 are from.
Canonicalization could be done as a server side post pass because the
information is stored in properties.</p>

<p>Note that this revision format will not scale on its own if you
have a list of million revisions.  None will easily.  However, because
it is stored in properties, one can change the WC and FS backends to
simply do something different with this single property if they wanted
to.  Given the rates of change of various very active repositories,
this will not be a problem we need to solve for many many years.</p>

<p>The current thinking is that the payload of
<code>SVN_MERGE_PROPERTY</code> will be stored in an index separate
from the FS which is created during <code>svnadmin create</code>.
This index will support fast querying, be populated during a merge or
<code>svnadmin load</code>, and cough up its contents during a
<code>svn propget SVN_MERGE_PROPERTY</code> or <code>svnadmin
dump</code>.  The contents of <code>SVN_MERGE_PROPERTY</code> will not
be stored redundantly in the FS (only in the index).  Dan Berlin is
prototyping this index using sqlite3, and David James has a (generic)
schema design underway.</p>

</div>  <!-- storage -->


<div class="h3">
<h3>Information Updating</h3>

<p>Each operation you can perform may update or copy the merge info
associated with a path, file, or revision.</p>

<p><code>svn add</code>:  No change to merge info</p>

<p><code>svn delete</code>: No direct change to merge info
(indirectly, because the props go away, so does the merge info for the
file)</p>

<p><code>svn rename</code>: No change to merge info</p>

<p><code>svn copy</code>: Copies the merge info from the source path
to the destination path, if any.</p>

<p>This includes copying info from revprops, if necessary, by
determining if the merge info exists in a revprop for the last changed
commit for the source path, and copying it to the new revprop if it
does (someone probably needs to check if this is the right semantic
:P)</p>

<p>All copies are full-copies of the merge information.</p>

<p><code>svn merge</code>: Adds or subtracts to the merge info,
according to the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Where to put the info:
  <ol>
    <li>If the merge target is a single file, the merge info goes to
    the property <code>SVN_MERGE_PROPERTY</code> set on that
    file.</li>

    <li>If the merge target is a non-wc-root directory, the merge info
    goes to the property <code>SVN_MERGE_PROPERTY</code> set on the
    directory.</li>

    <li>If the merge target is a wc-root directory, the merge info
    goes to the property <code>SVN_MERGE_PROPERTY</code> set on the
    revprop.</li>
  </ol>
  </li>

  <li>What info is put:
  <ol>
    <li>If you are merging in reverse, revisions are subtracted from
    the revision lines, but we never write out anti-revisions.  Thus,
    if you subtract all the merged revisions, you just get an empty
    list, and if you do a reverse merge from there, you still get an
    empty list.</li>

    <li>If you are merging forward, the revision(s) you are merging is
    added to the revision line in sorted order (such that all
    revisions and revision ranges in the list are monotonically
    increasing from left to right).  The exact details of how the
    range is represented in terms of a list of single revs, or a
    revision range, is left as a quality of implementation detail.
    The only requirement is that the range be correct.</li>

    <li>The path (known as PATHNAME in the grammar) used as the key to
    determine which revision line to change is the subdirectory path
    being merged from, relative to the repo root, with the repo url
    stripped from it.</li>
  </ol>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Thus a merge of revisions 1-9 from
http://foo.bar.com/reposroot/trunk would produce "/trunk:1-9"</p>

<p>cross-repo merging is a bridge we can cross if we ever get there :).</p>

<h3>Prerequisites</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Need to be able to set a revprop to be stored on commit (see <a
  href="http://subversion.tigris.org/issues/show_bug.cgi?id=1976">issue
  1976</a>).</li>

  <li>Need to be able to say to copy a revprop from a particular
  revision and only contact the server at commit time.</li>

  <li>Need to be able to have auth treat
  <code>SVN_MERGE_PROPERTY</code> revprop differently from other
  revprops (either by special casing the cases users do care about
  controlling, or special casing props users don't care about
  controlling, etc.) so that people who don't have access to the
  revprops can still do history sensitive merges of directories they
  do have access to.</li>

<div class="h3" id="merge-history-faq">
<h3>FAQ</h3>

<p class="question">What happens if someone commits a merge with a
non-merge tracking client?</p>

<p class="answer">It simply means the next time you merge, you may
receive conflicts that you would have received if you were using a
non-history-sensitive client.</p>

<p class="question">Can we do without the revprop portion of this
design?</p>

<p class="answer">Technically yes, but it may require more crawling
and querying at merge time.</p>

<p class="question">Can we do history sensitive WC-to-WC merges
without contacting the server?</p>

<p class="answer">No. But you probably couldn't anyway, even if the
"revprop not being stored locally" issue were not here.</p>

<p class="question">What happens if the merge history is not there?</p>

<p class="answer">The same thing that happens if the merge history is
not there now.</p>

<p class="question">What happens if a user edits merge history
incorrectly?</p>

<p class="answer">They get the results specified by their merge
history.</p>

<p class="question">How does the revprop stay up to date?</p>

<p class="answer">We copy it from revision to revision.</p>

<p class="question">What happens if a user manually edits a file and
unmerges a revision (e.g. not using a "reverse merge" command), but
doesn't update the merge info to match?</p>

<p class="answer">The merge info will believe the change has still
been merged.  This is a similar effect to performing a <a
href="requirements.html#manual-merge">manual merge</a>.</p>

<p class="question">What happens if I <code>svn
move</code>/<code>rename</code> a directory, and then merge it
somewhere?</p>

<p class="answer">This doesn't change history, only the future, thus
we will simply add the merge info for that directory as if it was a
new directory.  We will not do something like attempt to modify all
merge info to specify the new directory, as that would be wrong.</p>

<p class="question">I don't think only that copying info on <code>svn
copy</code> is correct.  What if you copy a dir with merge info into a
dir where the dir has merge info -- won't it get the info wrong
now?</p>

<div class="answer">
<p>No.  Let's say you have:</p>

<pre>
a/foo (merge info: /trunk:5-9
a/branches/bar (merge info: /trunk:1-4)
</pre>

<p>If you copy a/foo into a/branches/bar, we now have:</p>

<pre>
a/branches/bar (merge info: /trunk:1-4)
a/branches/bar/foo (merge info: /trunk:5-9)
</pre>

<p>This is strictly correct.  The only changes which have been merged
into a/branches/bar/foo, are still 5-9.  The only changes which have
been merged into /branches/bar are 1-4.  No merges have been performed
by your copy, only copies have been performed.  If you perform a merge
of revisions 1-9 into bar, the results one would expect that the
history sensitive merge algorithm will skip revisions 5-9 for
a/branches/bar/foo, and skip revisions 1-4 for a/branches/bar.  The
above information gives the algorithm the information necessary to do
this.

So if you want to argue svn copy has the wrong merge info semantics,
it's not because of the above, AFAIK :)</p>

<h3>Footnotes</h3>

<ol>
  <li>This is not going to be a full blown design for property
  inheritance, nor should this design depend on such a system being
  implemented.</li>

  <li>Assuming 4 byte revision numbers, and repos with revisions
  numbering in the hundreds of thousands.  You could do slightly
  better by variable length encoding of integers, but even that will
  generally be 4 bytes for hundreds of thousands of revs.  Thus, we
  have strings like "102341" vs 4 byte numbers, meaning you save about
  2 bytes for a 4 byte integer.  Range lists in binary would need a
  distinguisher from single revisions, adding a single bit to both
  (meaning you'd get 31 bit integers), and thus, would require 8 bytes
  per range vs 12 bytes per range.  While 30% is normally nothing to
  sneeze at space wise, it's also not significantly more efficient in
  time, as most of the time will not be spent parsing revision lists,
  but doing something with them. The space efficiency therefore does
  not seem to justify the cost you pay in not making them easily
  editable.</li>

<div class="h2" id="audit-operations">
<h2>Audit Operations</h2>

<p>As outlined in the 
<a href="requirements.html#auditing">requirements and use cases</a>, merge
tracking auditting is the ability to report information about merge
operations.  It consists of three sections:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Change Set Merge Availability (TODO)</li>

  <li>Find Change Set (TODO)</li>

  <li><a href="#commutative-reporting">Commutative Author and Revision
  Reporting</a></li>
</ul>

<div class="h3" id="commutative-reporting">
<h3>Commutative Author and Revision Reporting</h3>

<p>Most of the logic for reporting will live in <code>libsvn_repos</code>, with
appropriate changes to the API and additional parameters exposed to the client
through the RA layer.  We are looking at an API which takes one or more paths
and a revision (range?), and returns the merge info which was added or removed
in that revision.  For the 'blame' case, we may also need to include some type
of line number parameter, the handling of which is going to get ugly, since our
FS isn't based on a weave.</p>

<p>Existing functions of interest are <code>svn_repos_fs_get_merge_info()</code>
and <code>svn_fs_merge_info__get_merge_info()</code>.</p>

<div class="h4" id="audit-log">
<h4><code>svn log</code> Implementation</h4>
<p><em>This work is currently being done on the
<a href="http://svn.collab.net/repos/svn/branches/merge-sensitive-log/">
merge-sensitive-log</a> branch.</em></p>

<p>Prior to merge tracking, log messages had a linear relationship to one
another.  That is, the only information gleaned from the order in which a
message was returned was where the revision number of that message fell in
relation to the revision numbers of messages preceding and succeeding it.</p>

<p>The introduction of merge tracking changes that paradigm.  Log messages
for independent revisions are still linearly related as before, but log
messages for merging revisions now have children.  These children are log
messages for the revisions which have been merged, and they may in turn
also have children.</p>

<p>The result is a tree structure which the repository layer builds as it
collects log message information.  This tree structure then gets serialized
and marshaled back to the client, which can then rebuilt the tree if needed.
Additionally, less information needs to be explicitly given, as the tree
structure itself implies revision relationships.
</p>

<p>We currently use the <code>svn_log_message_receiver_t</code> interface
to return log messages between application layers.  To enable communication
of the tree structure, we add another parameter, <code>child_count</code>.
When <code>child_count</code> is zero, the node is a leaf node.  When
<code>child_count</code> is greater than zero, the node is an interior node,
with the given number of children.  These children may also have children and
indicate such by their own <code>child_count</code> parameters.  Children
are returned in-band through the receiver interface immediately following their
parents.  Consumers of this API can be aware of the number of children and
rebuild the tree, or pass the values farther up the application stack.  In
effect, this method implements a preorder traversal of the log message tree.</p>

<p>(For convenience, we may want to consolidate all the data parameters of
<code>svn_log_message_receiver_t</code> into a single structure.)</p>

<h4><code>svn blame</code> Implementation</h4>
