<h1>Subversion FAQ</h1>


<h2>Why does this project exist?</h2>

<p>To take over the CVS user base.  Specifically, we're writing a new
revision control system that is very similar to CVS, but fixes many
things that are broken.  See our front page.</p>


<h2>Is Subversion proprietary?  I heard that it belongs to CollabNet.</h2>

<p>No, Subversion is open source / free software.  CollabNet pays the
salaries of several full-time developers, and holds the copyright on
the code, but that copyright is <a
href="http://subversion.tigris.org/project_license.html">an
Apache/BSD-style license</a>
which is fully compliant with the <a
href="http://www.debian.org/social_contract#guidelines">Debian Free
Software Guidelines</a>.  In other words, you are free to download,
modify, and redistribute Subversion as you please; no permission from
CollabNet or anyone else is required.</p>



<h2>Is Subversion stable enough for me to use for my own projects?</h2>

<p>Yes and No.</p>

<p>We say "Yes" because we do believe that Subversion is
stable and have confidence in our code, so we've been self-hosting
since September of 2001--eating our own caviar so to speak.</p>

<p>We say "No" because if something goes wrong with our svn
repository, we've got a horde of active developers who will stay up
sleepless nights hunting down the problem and rescuing our data. As
altruistic as this horde might be, they don't have time to rescue the
data for thousands of people who are storing their data in a pre-alpha
product.</p>

<p>We say "No" because there's a good chance that the filesystem might
change before we go 1.0, and we don't plan on writing and testing and
shipping conversion utilities.</p>

<p>So, as long as you're willing to take those risks, then go right ahead
and use Subversion.</p>



<h2>Will Subversion run on my operating system?</h2>

<p>Subversion is written in ANSI C and uses the <a
href="http://apr.apache.org">Apache Portable Runtime</a> library as a
portability layer.  This means that Subversion will compile anywhere
Apache httpd does.  (Right now, this list includes all flavors of
Unix, Win32, BeOS, OS/2, MacOS X.)</p>


<h2>What's all this about a new filesystem?  Is it like ext2?</h2>

<p>No.  The "Subversion Filesystem" is not a kernel-level filesystem that
one would install in an operating system.  Instead, it refers to the
design of Subversion's repository.  The repository is built on a
database (currently <a href="http://www.sleepycat.com">Berkeley
DB</a>) and exports a C API that <i>simulates</i> a filesystem -- a
versioned filesystem.  Thus writing a program to access the repository
is like writing against other filesystem APIs.  The main difference is
that this particular filesystem doesn't lose data when written to; old
versions of files and directories are saved.</p>


<h2>I heard that Subversion is an Apache extension?</h2>

<p>No.  Subversion is a set of libraries.  It comes with a command-line
client that uses them.  The Subversion <i>server</i> is Apache + <a
href="http://www.webdav.org/mod_dav">mod_dav</a> + mod_dav_svn, and
the last module uses the Subversion libraries to speak to a
repository.  For more information about how Subversion uses WebDAV as
its network protocol, see our <a
href="http://subversion.tigris.org/servlets/ProjectDocumentList">docs.</a></p>


<h2>Does this mean I have to set up Apache to use Subversion?</h2>

<p>If you want to <b>host</b> a networked repository: yes.</p>
<p>If you just want to <b>access</b> a repository with your client: no.</p>

<p>For more details about setting up a network accessible Subversion
server, please see <a
href="http://subversion.tigris.org/server_setup.html">Server Setup</a>.</p>


<h2>Why don't you do X, just like SCM system Y?</h2>

<p>We aren't attempting to break new ground in SCM systems, nor are we
attempting to imitate all the best features of every SCM system out
there.  We're trying to replace CVS.  See the first question.</p>


<h2>When's the next release?</h2>

<p>See our <a
href="http://subversion.tigris.org/project_status.html">status
page</a>.</p>

<h2>I just built the distribution binary, and when I try to check out
Subversion, I get an error about an "Unrecognized URL scheme."  What's up
with that?</h2>

<p>Subversion uses a plugin system to allow access to repositories.  Currently
there are two of these plugins: ra_local allows access to a local
repository, and ra_dav which allows access to a repository via WebDAV
When you attempt to perform an operation in subversion, the program tries
to dynamically load a plugin based on the URL scheme.  A `file://' URL
will try to load ra_local, and an `http://' URL will try to load
ra_dav.</p>

<p>The error you are seeing means that the dynamic linker/loader can't find
the plugins to load.  This normally happens when you build subversion with
shared libraries, then attempt to run it without first running 'make
install'.  Another possible cause is that you ran make install, but the
libraries were installed in a location that the dynamic linker/loader
doesn't recognize.  Under Linux, you can allow the linker/loader to find the
libraries by adding the library directory to /etc/ld.so.conf and running
ldconfig.  If you don't wish to do this, or you don't have root access, you
can also specify the library directory in the LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment
variable.</p>

<h2>How do I create a repository?  How do I import data into it?</h2>

<p>See the latest <a
href="http://svn.collab.net/repos/svn/trunk/README">README</a>
document;  specifically, look at section IV, the "Quickstart Guide".</p>

<h2>I'm getting strange errors in my httpd error log, and Subversion
operations aren't working.</h2>

<p>
Sometimes you need to run Berkeley DB's recovery procedure.  Shut
down apache, cd into the relevant repository's `<tt>db</tt>'
subdirectory, and run
"<tt>/usr/local/BerkeleyDB.<i>X</i>.<i>Y</i>/bin/db_recover&nbsp;-ve</tt>".
<br>
(Substitute the appropriate major and minor revision numbers of 
Berkeley DB for "<i>X</i>" and "<i>Y</i>", of course.)
</p>
<p>
Of course, we'd prefer that the repository never require human
maintenance.  However, until we get all the bugs worked out, the above
will sometimes be necessary.
</p>

<h2>When I run `<tt>configure</tt>', I get errors about
<tt>subs-1.sed&nbsp;line&nbsp;38:&nbsp;Unterminated&nbsp;`s'&nbsp;command</tt>.
What's wrong?</h2>

<p>
You probably have old copies of
<tt>/usr/local/bin/apr-config</tt> and
<tt>/usr/local/bin/apu-config</tt> on your system.  Remove them, make
sure the <tt>apr/</tt> and <tt>apr-util/</tt> that you're
building with are completely up-to-date, and try again.
</p>

<h2>I'm running Subversion under windows and I can create a repository fine,
but I get errors trying to import or check out from it.  What's wrong?</h2>

<p>If the error looks something like:
<pre>
svn_error: #21085 : <URL is not a versioned resource>
  svn_ra_local__split_URL: Unable to find valid repository
</pre>
Then the problem is that Subversion doesn't yet handle file URLs that have a
drive specification.  Try changing to that drive then doing an import without
the drive spec.  For example:
<pre>
d:
svn import file:///some/path/to/repos/on/d/drive e:\file\to\be\imported
</pre>

<h2>I have other problems or questions about Subversion.  Where can I get
more information?</h2>

<p>Please send your questions or concerns to the Subversion Development <a
href="mailto:dev@subversion.tigris.org">mailing list</a>.  Alternatively,
several Subversion users and developers can usually be contacted via IRC on
channel #svn on <a
href="http://www.openprojects.net">irc.openprojects.net</a>.</p>
