<h1>Subversion FAQ</h1>



<h2>Why does this project exist?</h2>

To take over the CVS user base.  Specifically, we're writing a new
revision control system that is very similar to CVS, but fixes many
things that are broken.  See our front page.


<h2>Is Subversion proprietary?  I heard that it belongs to CollabNet.</h2>

CollabNet pays the salaries of at least four full-time developers, and
CollabNet owns the copyright on the code; but Subversion is an Open
Source project.  It has an Apache/BSD-style <a
href="http://subversion.tigris.org/project_license.html">license</a>
which is fully compliant with the <a
href="http://www.debian.org/social_contract#guidelines">Debian Free
Software Guidelines.</a>


<h2>Will Subversion run on my operating system?</h2>

Subversion is written in ANSI C and uses the <a
href="http://apr.apache.org">Apache Portable Runtime</a> library as a
portability layer.  This means that Subversion will compile anywhere
Apache httpd does.  (Right now, this list includes all flavors of
Unix, Win32, BeOS, OS/2, MacOS X.)


<h2>What's all this about a new filesystem?  Is it like ext2?</h2>

No.  The "Subversion Filesystem" is not a kernel-level filesystem that
one would install in an operating system.  Instead, it refers to the
design of Subversion's repository.  The repository is built on a
database (currently <a href="http://www.sleepycat.com">Berkeley
DB</a>) and exports a C API that <i>simulates</i> a filesystem.  That
is, if you want your programs to read and write to the repository, it
will be like other filesystem APIs.  The main difference is that
this particular filesystem never loses data when written to; old
versions of files and directories are saved.


<h2>I heard that Subversion in an Apache extension?</h2>

No.  Subversion is a set of libraries.  It comes with a command-line
client that uses them.  The Subversion <i>server</i> is Apache + <a
href="http://www.webdav.org/mod_dav">mod_dav</a> + mod_dav_svn, and
the last module uses the Subversion libraries to speak to a
repository.  For more information about how Subversion uses WebDAV as
its network protocol, see our <a
href="http://subversion.tigris.org/servlets/ProjectDocumentList">docs.</a>


<h2>Does this mean I have to set up Apache to use Subversion?</h2>

If you want to <b>host</b> a networked repository: yes.  <p>
If you just want to <b>access</b> a networked (or local) repository with your
client: no.


<h2>Why don't you do X, just like SCM system Y?</h2>

We aren't attempting to break new ground in SCM systems, nor are we
attempting to imitate all the best features of every SCM system out
there.  We're trying to replace CVS.  See the first question.


<h2>When's the next release?</h2>
