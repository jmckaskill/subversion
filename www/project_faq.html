<h2>General questions:</h2>
<p>

<![CDATA[-----------------------------------------------------------]]>

<h3><a name="why">Why does this project exist?</a></h3>

<p>To take over the CVS user base.  Specifically, we're writing a new
revision control system that is very similar to CVS, but fixes many
things that are broken.  See our front page.</p>

<![CDATA[-----------------------------------------------------------]]>

<h3><a name="collab">Is Subversion proprietary?  I heard that it
belongs to CollabNet.</a></h3>

<p>No, Subversion is open source / free software.  CollabNet pays the
salaries of several full-time developers, and holds the copyright on
the code, but that copyright is <a
href="http://subversion.tigris.org/project_license.html">an
Apache/BSD-style license</a>
which is fully compliant with the <a
href="http://www.debian.org/social_contract#guidelines">Debian Free
Software Guidelines</a>.  In other words, you are free to download,
modify, and redistribute Subversion as you please; no permission from
CollabNet or anyone else is required.</p>

<![CDATA[-----------------------------------------------------------]]>

<h3><a name="stable">Is Subversion stable enough for me to use for my
own projects?</a></h3>

<p><b>We think so!</b></p>

Because:
<ul>

<li>We believe that Subversion is stable and have confidence in our
code, in fact, we've been self-hosting since September of 2001--eating
our own caviar so to speak. We declared alpha because we're ready for
the world to try Subversion.</li>

<li>After 10 months of self-hosting, we haven't
lost any data <i>at all</i>.</li>

<li>The filesystem schema is stable now and shouldn't undergo any
changes before 1.0. In the off-chance that the schema does change, we
will provide a dump/load utility to aid you in the migration.</li>

<li>In order to make Subversion as stable as possible, we need more
people to use Subversion. If you use Subversion on a day-to-day basis,
you can help us find and fix any bugs that might turn up. It may sound
risky at first, but odds are that if you find any bugs they will be minor
inconveniences as opposed to data destroyers.</li>

<li>For many more reasons, read the feature list on the <a
href="http://subversion.tigris.org/">Subversion home page</a>.
 </li>

</ul>

<![CDATA[-----------------------------------------------------------]]>

<h3><a name="portability">What operating systems does Subversion run
    on?</a></h3>

<p>All modern flavors of Unix, Win32, BeOS, OS/2, MacOS X.</p>

<p>See <a href="http://svn.collab.net/repos/svn/trunk/PORTING">
http://svn.collab.net/repos/svn/trunk/PORTING</a> for details about
individual platforms.</p>

<p>Subversion is written in ANSI C and uses APR, the <a
href="http://apr.apache.org">Apache Portable Runtime</a> library, as a
portability layer.  Although the Subversion client will compile
anywhere APR does, the Subversion server depends on <a
href="http://www.sleepycat.com">Berkeley DB</a> (as well as Apache
2.X, but Apache is as portable as APR).  In theory Berkeley DB is
portable to most of those platforms as well (except Win95/Win98, where
it's known not to work due to shared-memory segment problems).  In
practice, it's difficult to get the Subversion repository running on
non-Unix platforms; if you succeed, we'd like to hear about it.</p>

<![CDATA[-----------------------------------------------------------]]>

<h3><a name="filesystem">What's all this about a new filesystem?  Is
it like ext2?</a></h3>

<p>No.  The "Subversion Filesystem" is not a kernel-level filesystem that
one would install in an operating system.  Instead, it refers to the
design of Subversion's repository.  The repository is built on a
database (currently <a href="http://www.sleepycat.com">Berkeley
DB</a>) and exports a C API that <i>simulates</i> a filesystem -- a
versioned filesystem.  Thus writing a program to access the repository
is like writing against other filesystem APIs.  The main difference is
that this particular filesystem doesn't lose data when written to; old
versions of files and directories are saved.</p>

<![CDATA[-----------------------------------------------------------]]>

<h3><a name="apache-extension">I heard that Subversion is an Apache
extension?</a></h3>

<p>No.  Subversion is a set of libraries.  It comes with a command-line
client that uses them.  The Subversion <i>server</i> is Apache + <a
href="http://www.webdav.org/mod_dav">mod_dav</a> + mod_dav_svn, and
the last module uses the Subversion libraries to speak to a
repository.  For more information about how Subversion uses WebDAV as
its network protocol, see our <a
href="http://subversion.tigris.org/servlets/ProjectDocumentList">docs.</a></p>

<![CDATA[-----------------------------------------------------------]]>

<h3><a name="need-apache">Does this mean I have to set up Apache to
use Subversion?</a></h3>

<p>If you want to <b>host</b> a networked repository: yes.</p>
<p>If you just want to <b>access</b> a repository with your client: no.</p>

<p>For more details about setting up a network accessible Subversion
server, please read our <a
href="http://svn.collab.net/repos/svn/trunk/INSTALL">INSTALL</a> document.</p>

<![CDATA[-----------------------------------------------------------]]>

<h3>I run Apache 1.x right now, and can't switch to Apache 2.0 just to
serve Subversion repositories.  <a name="multiple-apachim">
Does that mean I can't run a Subversion server?</a></h3>

<p> Don't worry, you can run Apache 2.0 on a different port, while
continuing to run Apache 1.x on port 80.  Different versions of Apache
can happily coexist on the same machine.  Just change the
<tt>Listen</tt> directive in httpd.conf from "<tt>Listen&nbsp;80</tt>"
to "<tt>Listen&nbsp;8080</tt>" or whatever port number you want, and
make sure to specify that port when you publish your repository URL
(e.g., <tt>http://svn.mydomain.com:8080/repos/blah/trunk/</tt>).</p>

<![CDATA[-----------------------------------------------------------]]>

<h3><a name="feature-x">Why don't you do X, just like SCM system Y?</a></h3>

<p>We aren't attempting to break new ground in SCM systems, nor are we
attempting to imitate all the best features of every SCM system out
there.  We're trying to replace CVS.  See the first question.</p>

<![CDATA[-----------------------------------------------------------]]>

<h3><a name="globalrev">Why does the entire repository share the 
    same revision number? I want each of my projects to have their
    own revision numbers.</a></h3>
<p>
The global revision number attached to the repository as a whole is
meaningless from a user's perspective. It's an internal mechanism that
accomplishes the goal of the underlying schema design. It just so
happens to be exposed so that the user's interface can sometimes be a
little more convenient than always having to type obnoxiously long
date/time strings.
</p>

<p>
The revision number is only relevant to the repository, and user
convenience. It has <b>no</b> impact on any other factor of what you
store in the repository.  Repository revision number bumps aren't
nearly useful enough to be an accurate indication of the real rate of
change of a given code base.  There are other more complicated ways to
get a much better picture of a code-base's rate of change.
</p>

<h2>How-to:</h2>
<p>

<![CDATA[-----------------------------------------------------------]]>

<h3><a name="repository">How do I create a repository?  How do I
import data into it?</a></h3>

<p>See <a
href="http://svn.collab.net/repos/svn/trunk/README">
http://svn.collab.net/repos/svn/trunk/README</a>;  specifically, look
at section IV, the "Quickstart Guide".</p>

<![CDATA[-----------------------------------------------------------]]>

<h3><a name="proxy">What if I'm behind a proxy?</a></h3>

<p>The Subversion client can go through a proxy, if you configure it
to do so.  First, edit your ~/.subversion/proxies configuration file
to indicate which proxy to use.  There are comments in the file
explaining how to do this.  If you don't have that file, get the
latest Subversion client and run any command; this will cause the
configuration directory and template files to be created.</p>

<p>Next, you need to make sure the proxy server itself supports all
the HTTP methods Subversion uses.  Some proxy servers do not support
these methods by default: PROPFIND, REPORT, MERGE, MKACTIVITY,
CHECKOUT.  In general, solving this depends on the particular proxy
software.  For Squid, the config option is</p>

<pre>
   #  TAG: extension_methods
   #       Squid only knows about standardized HTTP request methods.
   #       You can add up to 20 additional "extension" methods here.
   #
   #Default:
   # none
   extension_methods REPORT MERGE MKACTIVITY CHECKOUT
</pre>

<p>(Squid 2.4 and later already knows about PROPFIND.)</p>

<p>See also "<a href="#http-methods">What are all the HTTP methods
Subversion uses?</a>" for advice on additional HTTP methods to allow
through your proxy.</p>

<p>If it's difficult or impossible to get the proxy to allow
Subversion traffic, but you want to check out the Subversion sources,
you may be able to go around the proxy.  Some proxies that filter port
80 nevertheless allow anything on port 81.  For this reason, the
<tt>svn.collab.net</tt> repository server listens on port 81 as well
as on port 80.  Try:</p>

<pre>
   svn checkout http://svn.collab.net:81/repos/svn/trunk subversion
</pre>

<p>and maybe the proxy will let you through.</p>

<![CDATA[=========================================================]]>

<h3><a name="paranoid"/>My admins don't want me to have a HTTP server for
    Subversion.  What can I do if I still want remote usage?</h3>

<p>If you previously used CVS, you may have used SSH to login to the
CVS server.  The preferred solution would be to use ra_dav combined
with an Apache HTTP server configured with mod_ssl and appropriate
authentication support.  This should provide enough security for most
users.  However, we realize that there are places that do not allow
adding servers of any kind with external connectivity.</p>

<p>There has been work on a ra_pipe implementation that would work
similarly to the CVS_RSH mechanism, but it is not currently complete.
If you wish to contribute to its development, you are more than
welcome to do so!</p>

<p>However, another solution that can be used instead is to leverage
SSH port forwarding to connect to the protected server via ra_dav.
You would connect via SSH to a machine behind your firewall that can
access your Subversion server.  Note that this SSH server does
<b>not</b> have to be the same as where Subversion is installed.  It
can be, but it doesn't have to be.</p>

<p>Then, you create a local port forward that connects to the HTTP
server that houses your Subversion repository.  You would then
'connect' to the Subversion repository via this local port.  Then,
the request will be sent 'tunneled' via SSH server to your Subversion
server.</p>

<p>An example: a Subversion ra_dav setup is behind your company firewall
at 10.1.1.50 (call it svn-server.example.com).  Your company allows SSH
access via publicly accessible ssh-server.example.com. Internally, you
can access the Subversion repository via
http://svn-server.example.com/repos/ours.</p>

<p><i>Example</i>: client connecting to ssh-server with port-forwarding
and checking out via the port forward</p>

<pre>
% ssh -L 8888:svn-server.example.com:80 me@ssh-server.example.com
% svn checkout http://localhost:8888/repos/ours
</pre>

<p>Note that your svn-server.example.com could also have its httpd
instance running on an unpriviliged port by a non-trusted user.  This
will allow your Subversion server not to require root access.</p>

<!-- Can you use svn switch to switch your WC between your internal and
     external Subversion server?  I think so.  -->

<p>Joe Orton notes</p>
<pre>
The server is sensitive to the hostname used in the Destination header
in MOVE and COPY requests, so you have to be a little careful here - a
"ServerAlias localhost" may be required to get this working properly.

<h2>Troubleshooting:</h2>
<p>

<![CDATA[-----------------------------------------------------------]]>

<h3>I just built the distribution binary, and when I try to check out
Subversion, I get an error about an "Unrecognized URL scheme."  What's up
with<a name="unrecognized-url-error"> that?</a></h3>

<p>Subversion uses a plugin system to allow access to repositories.  Currently
there are two of these plugins: ra_local allows access to a local
repository, and ra_dav which allows access to a repository via WebDAV
When you attempt to perform an operation in subversion, the program tries
to dynamically load a plugin based on the URL scheme.  A `file://' URL
will try to load ra_local, and an `http://' URL will try to load
ra_dav.</p>

<p>The error you are seeing means that the dynamic linker/loader can't find
the plugins to load.  This normally happens when you build subversion with
shared libraries, then attempt to run it without first running 'make
install'.  Another possible cause is that you ran make install, but the
libraries were installed in a location that the dynamic linker/loader
doesn't recognize.  Under Linux, you can allow the linker/loader to find the
libraries by adding the library directory to /etc/ld.so.conf and running
ldconfig.  If you don't wish to do this, or you don't have root access, you
can also specify the library directory in the LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment
variable.</p>

<![CDATA[-----------------------------------------------------------]]>

<h3><a name="db-recover">I'm getting errors finding or opening a repository,
    but I know my repository URL is correct.  What's wrong?</a></h3> 

<p>Sometimes you'll see errors that look like this:</p>

<blockquote>
<pre>
svn_error: #21100 : &lt;Couldn't find a repository.&gt;
  svn_ra_local__split_URL: Unable to find valid repository
   (file:///path/to/repos)
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>or</p>

<blockquote>
<pre>
svn_error: #21089 : &lt;Berkeley DB error&gt;
  REPORT request failed on /my-repos

svn_error: #21089 : &lt;Berkeley DB error&gt;
  
Berkeley DB error while opening environment for filesystem /path/to/repos:
No such file or directory
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>These sometimes mean that a repository administrator should run:</p>

<blockquote>
<pre>
db_recover -ve -h /path/to/repos/db
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>Make sure you run this command as the user that owns and manages
the database and not as root because running <tt>db_recover</tt> as
root will leave root owned files in the db directory which cannot be
opened by the non-root user that manages the database, which is
typically your Apache process.</p>

<p>Yes, we consider it a bug that <tt>db_recover</tt> needs to be run
at all.  We're working on it, and volunteers are welcome :-).
</p>

<![CDATA[-----------------------------------------------------------]]>

<h3>I'm getting strange errors in my httpd error log, and Subversion
operations aren't working.</h3>

<p>Sometimes you need to run Berkeley DB's recovery procedure.  Shut
down apache, cd into the relevant repository's `<tt>db</tt>'
subdirectory, and run
"<tt>/usr/local/BerkeleyDB.<i>X</i>.<i>Y</i>/bin/db_recover&nbsp;-ve</tt>".
<br>
(Substitute the appropriate major and minor revision numbers of 
Berkeley DB for "<i>X</i>" and "<i>Y</i>", of course.)
</p>
<p>
Of course, we'd prefer that the repository never require human
maintenance.  However, until we get all the bugs worked out, the above
will sometimes be necessary.
</p>

<![CDATA[-----------------------------------------------------------]]>

<h3>When I run `<tt>configure</tt>', I get errors about
<tt>subs-1.sed&nbsp;line&nbsp;38:&nbsp;Unterminated&nbsp;`s'&nbsp;command</tt>.
What<a name="configure-sed-error">'s wrong?</a></h3>

<p>
You probably have old copies of
<tt>/usr/local/bin/apr-config</tt> and
<tt>/usr/local/bin/apu-config</tt> on your system.  Remove them, make
sure the <tt>apr/</tt> and <tt>apr-util/</tt> that you're
building with are completely up-to-date, and try again.
</p>

<![CDATA[-----------------------------------------------------------]]>
 
<h3>I'm having trouble building Subversion under Windows with MSVC++ 6.0.
<a name="windows-msvc-build"> What should I do?</a></h3>

<p>
Probably you just need to get the latest platform SDK.  The one that
ships with VC++ 6.0 is not recent enough.
</p>

<![CDATA[-----------------------------------------------------------]]>

<h3>I'm running Subversion under windows and I can create a repository
fine, but <a name="windows-repository">I get errors trying to import
or check out from it.  What's wrong?</a></h3>

<p>If the error looks something like:
<pre>
svn_error: #21085 : <URL is not a versioned resource>
  svn_ra_local__split_URL: Unable to find valid repository
</pre>
Then the problem is that Subversion doesn't yet handle file URLs that have a
drive specification.  Try changing to that drive then doing an import without
the drive spec.  For example:
<pre>
d:
svn import file:///some/path/to/repos/on/d/drive e:\file\to\be\imported
</pre>

<![CDATA[-----------------------------------------------------------]]>

<h3>I'm having trouble doing write <a name="write-over-dav">
    operations to a Subversion repository over a network.</a></h3>

<p>For example, one user reported that imports worked fine over local
access:
<ul>
<pre>
  $ mkdir test
  $ touch test/testfile
  $ svn import file:///var/svn/test test test -m "Initial import"
  Adding         test/testfile
  Transmitting file data .
  Committed revision 1.
</pre>
</ul>
But not from a remote host:
<ul>
<pre>
  $ svn import http://svn.sabi.net/test testfile -m "import"
  nicholas's password: xxxxxxx

  svn_error: #21110 : <Activity not found>

  The specified activity does not exist.
</pre>
</ul>
</p>

<p> We've seen this when the REPOS/dav/ directory is not writable by
the httpd process.  Check the permissions to ensure Apache can write
to the <tt>dav/</tt> directory (and to <tt>db/</tt>, of course).  </p>

<![CDATA[=========================================================]]>


<h3>Under Windows XP, the Subversion server sometimes seems to send
    out corrupted data. <a name="windows-xp-server"> Can this really
    be happening?</a></h3>

<p>Yes, it seems so.  We <i>think</i> this may be due to a bug in the
XP network code, that Apache has already run into: see</p>

    <ul>
    <a href="http://www.apache.org/dist/httpd/binaries/win32/#xpbug"
    >http://www.apache.org/dist/httpd/binaries/win32/#xpbug</a>
    </ul>
<p>
and

    >http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=kb;EN-US;q317949</a>
    </ul>

</p>

<p>for details, and also see the thread "Question about propset" on
the Subversion dev list.  Here's one message from late in that thread:</p>

<p>
    <ul>
<a href="http://subversion.tigris.org/servlets/ReadMsg?list=dev&msgId=185063"
  >http://subversion.tigris.org/servlets/ReadMsg?list=dev&msgId=185063</a>
    </ul>
</p>

<p>For now, our only advice is "Don't run a Subversion server from
Windows XP."</p>

<p>The following email says it all.  As the author points out,
Subversion does not actually use all of these WebDAV/DeltaV methods
yet, but it probably will someday, so if you're configuring a proxy,
you might as well allow all of them:</p>

&gt; uses include at least the following:
&gt;
&gt; GET, PROPFIND, REPORT, OPTIONS, MERGE, MKACTIVITY, and CHECKOUT
&gt;
&gt; But since the lists I can find are only partial lists and nowhere
&gt; does it suggest these are all the ones used, I'm reluctant to make
&gt; any assumptions.
&gt;
&gt; If I had a complete list, I could go to the corp. proxy guy once
&gt; instead of many times, and reduce the risk of pissing him off and
&gt; being left with inadequate svn support in the proxy.

<a href="http://www.webdav.org/deltav/WWW10/deltav-intro.htm">http://www.webdav.org/deltav/WWW10/deltav-intro.htm</a>

A list copied from there:

HTTP/1.1: GET, HEAD, POST, PUT, DELETE, OPTIONS, TRACE, CONNECT

WebDAV: LOCK, UNLOCK, PROPFIND, PROPPATCH, COPY, MOVE, MKCOL

DeltaV: CHECKIN, CHECKOUT, UNCHECKOUT, VERSION-CONTROL, REPORT,
UPDATE, LABEL, MERGE, MKWORKSPACE, BASELINE-CONTROL, MKACTIVITY

Subversion uses no methods outside these. It doesn't use all of them
either, but it's better to support the full WebDAV/DeltaV than just
some arbitrary subset. If the proxy being configured is a recent
Squid, it probably has everything from HTTP/1.1 and WebDAV - and then
it only needs the DeltaV extensions added.

You can give that list to your corp. proxy guy and explain to him that
he can check the RFC's for further information.
