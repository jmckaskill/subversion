<h1>Subversion FAQ</h1>


<h2>Why does this project exist?</h2>

<p>To take over the CVS user base.  Specifically, we're writing a new
revision control system that is very similar to CVS, but fixes many
things that are broken.  See our front page.</p>


<h2>Is Subversion proprietary?  I heard that it belongs to CollabNet.</h2>

<p>No, Subversion is open source / free software.  CollabNet pays the
salaries of several full-time developers, and holds the copyright on
the code, but that copyright is <a
href="http://subversion.tigris.org/project_license.html">an
Apache/BSD-style license</a>
which is fully compliant with the <a
href="http://www.debian.org/social_contract#guidelines">Debian Free
Software Guidelines</a>.  In other words, you are free to download,
modify, and redistribute Subversion as you please; no permission from
CollabNet or anyone else is required.</p>


<h2>Will Subversion run on my operating system?</h2>

<p>Subversion is written in ANSI C and uses the <a
href="http://apr.apache.org">Apache Portable Runtime</a> library as a
portability layer.  This means that Subversion will compile anywhere
Apache httpd does.  (Right now, this list includes all flavors of
Unix, Win32, BeOS, OS/2, MacOS X.)</p>


<h2>What's all this about a new filesystem?  Is it like ext2?</h2>

<p>No.  The "Subversion Filesystem" is not a kernel-level filesystem that
one would install in an operating system.  Instead, it refers to the
design of Subversion's repository.  The repository is built on a
database (currently <a href="http://www.sleepycat.com">Berkeley
DB</a>) and exports a C API that <i>simulates</i> a filesystem -- a
versioned filesystem.  Thus writing a program to access the repository
is like writing against other filesystem APIs.  The main difference is
that this particular filesystem doesn't lose data when written to; old
versions of files and directories are saved.</p>


<h2>I heard that Subversion is an Apache extension?</h2>

<p>No.  Subversion is a set of libraries.  It comes with a command-line
client that uses them.  The Subversion <i>server</i> is Apache + <a
href="http://www.webdav.org/mod_dav">mod_dav</a> + mod_dav_svn, and
the last module uses the Subversion libraries to speak to a
repository.  For more information about how Subversion uses WebDAV as
its network protocol, see our <a
href="http://subversion.tigris.org/servlets/ProjectDocumentList">docs.</a></p>


<h2>Does this mean I have to set up Apache to use Subversion?</h2>

<p>If you want to <b>host</b> a networked repository: yes.</p>
<p>If you just want to <b>access</b> a networked (or local) repository with your
client: no.</p>

<p>For more details about setting up a network accessible Subversion
server, please read the file notes/dav_setup.txt in the Subversion source
tree.</p>


<h2>Why don't you do X, just like SCM system Y?</h2>

<p>We aren't attempting to break new ground in SCM systems, nor are we
attempting to imitate all the best features of every SCM system out
there.  We're trying to replace CVS.  See the first question.</p>


<h2>When's the next release?</h2>

<p>See our <a
href="http://subversion.tigris.org/project_status.html">status
page</a>.</p>

<h2>I just built the distribution binary, and when I try to check out
Subversion, I get an error about an "Unrecognized URL scheme."  What's up
with that?</h2>

<p>Subversion uses a plugin system to allow access to repositories.  Currently
there are two of these plugins: ra_local allows access to a local
repository, and ra_dav which allows access to a repository via WebDAV
When you attempt to perform an operation in subversion, the program tries
to dynamically load a plugin based on the URL scheme.  A `file://' URL
will try to load ra_local, and an `http://' URL will try to load
ra_dav.</p>

<p>The error you are seeing means that the dynamic linker/loader can't find
the plugins to load.  This normally happens when you build subversion with
shared libraries, then attempt to run it without first running 'make
install'.  Another possible cause is that you ran make install, but the
libraries were installed in a location that the dynamic linker/loader
doesn't recognize.  Under Linux, you can allow the linker/loader to find the
libraries by adding the library directory to /etc/ld.so.conf and running
ldconfig.  If you don't wish to do this, or you don't have root access, you
can also specify the library directory in the LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment
variable.</p>

<h2>I have other problems or questions about Subversion.  Where can I get
more information?</h2>

<p>Please send your questions or concerns to the Subversion Development <a
href="mailto:dev@subversion.tigris.org">mailing list</a>.  Alternatively,
several Subversion users and developers can usually be contacted via IRC on
channel #svn on <a
href="http://www.openprojects.net">irc.openprojects.net</a>.</p>
