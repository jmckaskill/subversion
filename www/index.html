<h3>What Is Subversion?</h3>

<p>
The goal of the Subversion project is to build a version control
system that is a compelling replacement for CVS in the open source
community.  The software is released under an <a
href="/license-1.html">Apache/BSD-style</a> open source license.
See the <a href="/project_status.html">status page</a> for current
progress.

<h2>Features of Subversion</h2>
<p>

<ul>  <!-- list of features -->

<li><strong>Most current CVS features.</strong>
    <p>Subversion is meant to be a better CVS, so it has most of
    CVS's features.  Generally, Subversion's interface to a particular
    feature is similar to CVS's, except where there's a compelling
    reason to do otherwise.</p>
</li>

<li><strong>Directories, renames, and file meta-data are versioned.</strong>
    <p>Lack of these features is one of the most common complaints
    against CVS.  Subversion versions not only file contents and file
    existence, but also directories, copies, and renames.  It also
    allows arbitrary metadata ("properties") to be versioned along
    with any file or directory, and provides a mechanism for
    versioning the `execute' permission flag on files.
 </p>
</li>

<li><strong>Commits are truly atomic.</strong>
    <p>No part of a commit takes effect until the entire commit has
    succeeded.  Revision numbers are per-commit, not per-file; log
    messages are attached to the revision, not stored redundantly as
    in CVS.</p>
</li>

<li><strong>Apache network server option, with WebDAV/DeltaV
    protocol.</strong>
    <p>Subversion can use the HTTP-based WebDAV/DeltaV protocol for network
    communications, and the Apache web server to provide
    repository-side network service.  This gives Subversion an
    advantage over CVS in interoperability, and provides various key
    features for free: authentication, path-based authorization, wire
    compression, and basic repository browsing. </p>
</li>

<li><strong>Standalone server option.</strong> 
    <p>Subversion also offers a standalone server option using a
    custom protocol (not everyone wants to run Apache 2.x).  The
    standalone server can run as an inetd service, or in daemon mode,
    and offers basic authentication and authorization.  It can also be
    tunnelled over ssh.</p>
</li>

<li><strong>Branching and tagging are cheap (constant time) operations</strong>
    <p>There is no reason for these operations to be expensive, so
    they aren't.</p>

    <p>Branches and tags are both implemented in terms of an
    underlying "copy" operation.  A copy takes up a small, constant
    amount of space.  Any copy is a tag; and if you start committing
    on a copy, then it's a branch as well.  (This does away with CVS's
    "branch-point tagging", by removing the distinction that made
    branch-point tags necessary in the first place.)</p>
</li>

<li><strong>Natively client/server, layered library design</strong>
    <p> Subversion is designed to be client/server from the beginning;
    thus avoiding some of the maintenance problems which have plagued
    CVS.  The code is structured as a set of modules with well-defined
    interfaces, designed to be called by other applications.</p>
</li>

<li><strong>Client/server protocol sends diffs in both directions</strong>
    <p>The network protocol uses bandwidth efficiently by transmitting
    diffs in both directions whenever possible (CVS sends diffs from
    server to client, but not client to server).</p>
</li>

<li><strong>Costs are proportional to change size, not data size</strong>
    <p>In general, the time required for an Subversion operation is
    proportional to the size of the <i>changes</i> resulting from that
    operation, not to the absolute size of the project in which the
    changes are taking place.  This is a property of the Subversion
    repository model.</p>
</li>

<li><strong>Efficient handling of binary files</strong>
    <p>Subversion is equally efficient on binary as on text files,
    because it uses a binary diffing algorithm to transmit and store
    successive revisions.</p>
</li>

<li><strong>Parseable output</strong>
    <p>All output of the Subversion command-line client is carefully
    designed to be both human readable and automatically parseable;
    scriptability is a high priority.
</p>
</li>

</ul>  <!-- end list of features -->

<p>
<h2>Features planned for after 1.0</h2>
<p>

<ul>

<li><strong>Exclusive locking</strong>
    <p>Occasionally, a model of change control where files are
       explicitly checked out for exclusive editing is most
       appropriate, particularly with binary files which cannot be
       merged.  CVS calls this reserved checkouts.  This feature has
       high priority for post-1.0 implementation, probably in
       Subversion 1.1.</p>

<li><strong>Better merge support</strong>
    <p>Improved support for selective merges from related lines of
       development, and for repeated merges.  (Currently,
       Subversion's merge support is essentially the same as
       CVS's.)</p>
</li>

<li><strong>Broader WebDAV compatibility</strong>
    <p>Currently, the Subversion server only responds to a subset of
    WebDAV requests -- the subset necessary to support Subversion's
    own functionality.  Increased support for WebDAV is a high
    priority after the 1.0 release, however.</p>
</li>

<li><strong>Support for plug-in client side diff programs</strong>
    <p>Subversion knows how to show diffs for text files, and can also
    use an external diff program to do so.  Later, the user will
    have the option to plug in external diff programs for any kind of
    file.</p>
</li>

<li><strong>Internationalization</strong>
    <p>Subversion will have I18N support -- commands, user messages, and
    errors can be customized to the appropriate human language at
    runtime.  Also, there will be I18N support for the <i>names</i>
    as well as the contents of versioned entities.
</li>

<li><strong>Progressive multi-lingual support</strong>
    <p>In order to support keyword expansion and platform-dependent
    line-ending conversion, CVS makes a distinction between text and
    binary files, and treats the text files specially.</p>

    <p>Subversion makes the same distinction, but will offer a more
    generous notion of what constitutes a text file: not only ASCII,
    but UTF-* encodings of Unicode too.  UTF-8 is the first priority,
    with other encodings following if needed.</p>
</li>

</ul>
