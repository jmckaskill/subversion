<p>
The goal of the Subversion project is to build a version control
system that is a compelling replacement for CVS in the open source
community.  The software is released under an <a
href="/license-1.html">Apache/BSD-style</a> open source license.
See the <a href="/project_status.html">status page</a> for current
progress.

<h2>Features planned for Subversion 1.0:</h2>
<p>

<ul>  <!-- list of features -->

<li><strong>Most current CVS features.</strong>
    <p>Subversion is trying to be a better CVS, so it will have all
    CVS features eventually, with most of them in the 1.0 release.
    The two main exceptions are modules and "svn&nbsp;blame"
    (i.e., "cvs annotate"), which have been put off until after 1.0
    for scheduling reasons.  Generally, Subversion's interface to a
    particular feature is as similar to CVS's as possible, except
    where there's a compelling reason to do otherwise.</p>
</li>

<li><strong>Directories, renames, and file meta-data are versioned.</strong>
    <p>Lack of these features is one of the most common complaints
    against CVS.  Subversion versions not only file contents and file
    existence, but also directories, copies, and renames.  It also
    allows arbitrary metadata ("properties") to be versioned along
    with any file or directory, and provides a mechanism for
    versioning the `execute' permission flag on files.
 </p>
</li>

<li><strong>Commits are truly atomic.</strong>
    <p>No part of a commit takes effect until the entire commit has
    succeeded.  Revision numbers are per-commit, not per-file; log
    messages are attached to the revision, not stored redundantly as
    in CVS.</p>
</li>

<li><strong>Apache as network server, WebDAV/DeltaV for protocol</strong>
    <p>Subversion uses the HTTP-based WebDAV/DeltaV protocol for
    network communications, and uses the Apache web server to provide
    repository-side network service.  This gives Subversion a big
    advantage in stability and interoperability, and provides various
    key features for free: authentication, basic authorization,
    wire compression, and repository browsing, for example.</p> 
</li>

<li><strong>Branching and tagging are cheap (constant time) operations</strong>
    <p>There is no reason for these operations to be expensive, so
    they aren't.</p>

    <p>Branches and tags are both implemented in terms of an
    underlying "copy" operation.  An copy takes up a small, constant
    amount of space.  Any copy is a tag; and if you start committing
    on a copy, then it's a branch as well.  (This does away with CVS's
    "branch-point tagging", by removing the distinction that made
    branch-point tags necessary in the first place.)</p>
</li>

<li><strong>Natively client/server, layered library design</strong>
    <p> Subversion is designed to be client/server from the beginning;
    thus avoiding some of the maintenance problems which have plagued
    CVS.  The code is structured as a set of modules with well-defined
    interfaces, designed to be called by other applications.</p>
</li>

<li><strong>Client/server protocol sends diffs in both directions</strong>
    <p>The network protocol uses bandwidth efficiently by transmitting
    diffs in both directions whenever possible (CVS sends diffs from
    server to client, but not client to server).</p>
</li>

<li><strong>Costs are proportional to change size, not data size</strong>
    <p>In general, the time required for an Subversion operation is
    proportional to the size of the <i>changes</i> resulting from that
    operation, not to the absolute size of the project in which the
    changes are taking place.  This is a property of the Subversion
    repository model.</p>
</li>

<li><strong>Efficient handling of binary files</strong>
    <p>Subversion is equally efficient on binary as on text files,
    because it uses a binary diffing algorithm to transmit and store
    successive revisions.</p>
</li>

<li><strong>Parseable output</strong>
    <p>All output of the Subversion command-line client is carefully
    designed to be both human readable and automatically parseable;
    scriptability is a high priority.
</p>
</li>

</ul>  <!-- end list of features -->

<p>
<h2>Features planned for after 1.0:</h2>
<p>

<ul>

<li><strong>Support for symbolic links</strong>
    <p>Subversion will handle symbolic links ("shortcuts").  It may
    also support multiple hard links and other special file types, as
    long as this can be done portably and with semantics that are
    compatible with version control.</p>
</li>

<li><strong>"svn blame" (cvs annotate)</strong>
    <p>Subversion will have a counterpart to CVS's "annotate"
    feature, but it will most likely happen after the 1.0 release,
    due to prioritization and scheduling.</p> 
</li>

<li><strong>Graceful handling of repeated merges</strong>
    <p>Subversion will use its generic metadata mechanism as a way of
    remembering what has been merged, so that repeated merges from the
    same source do not require careful human calculation to avoid
    spurious conflicts (anyone who's done repeated CVS merges knows
    what we're talking about).</p>

    <p>(There are some theoretical problems with remembering merge
    sources -- knowing where the merged data came from implies some
    sort of universal repository registry.  However, our first goal is
    to make sure that multiple merges from branches made <i>in the
    same repository as the original project</i> compound gracefully.
    Remembering merges from remote sources is more difficult, due to
    the difficulty of distinguishing remote sources, but there are
    good "90%" solutions that will work in practice).</p>
</li>

<li><strong>Broader WebDAV compatibility</strong>
    <p>Currently, the Subversion server only responds to a subset of
    WebDAV requests -- the subset necessary to support Subversion's
    own functionality.  Increased support for WebDAV is a high
    priority after the 1.0 release, however.</p>
</li>

<li><strong>module support</strong>
    <p>Subversion will have something like CVS's modules (but
    hopefully a more flexible mechanism); several designs are being
    considered.</p>
</li>

<li><strong>Support for plug-in client side diff programs</strong>
    <p>Subversion knows how to show diffs for text files, and later
    will also give the user the option to plug in external diff
    programs for any kind of file.  The external program need merely
    conform to some simple invocation interface (i.e., "<tt>diffprog
    file1 file2 [file3...]</tt>", where the various files might be
    different revisions of the same file).</p>
</li>

<li><strong>Internationalization</strong>
    <p>Subversion will have I18N support -- commands, user messages, and
    errors can be customized to the appropriate human language at
    build-time.  Also, there will be I18N support for the <i>names</i>
    as well as the contents of versioned entities.
</li>

<li><strong>Progressive multi-lingual support</strong>
    <p>In order to support keyword expansion and platform-dependent
    line-ending conversion, CVS makes a distinction between text and
    binary files, and treats the text files specially.</p>

    <p>Subversion makes the same distinction, but will offer a more
    generous notion of what constitutes a text file: not only ASCII,
    but UTF-* encodings of Unicode too.  UTF-8 is the first priority,
    with other encodings following if needed.</p>
</li>

</ul>
