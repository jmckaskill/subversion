<p>Subversion 1.6 is a superset of all previous Subversion releases,
and is considered the current "best" release.  Any feature or bugfix
in 1.0.x through 1.5.x is also in 1.6, but 1.6 contains features and
bugfixes not present in any earlier release.  The new features will
eventually be documented in a 1.6 version of the free Subversion book
(<a href="http://svnbook.red-bean.com" >svnbook.red-bean.com</a>).</p>

<p>This page describes only major changes.  For a complete list of
changes, see the 1.6 section of the <a
href="http://svn.collab.net/repos/svn/trunk/CHANGES" >CHANGES</a>
file.</p>

<div class="h2" id="compatibility" title="compatibility">
<h2>Compatibility Concerns</h2>

<p>Older clients and servers interoperate transparently with 1.6
servers and clients.  However, some of the new 1.6 features (e.g., <a
href="#XXX" >XXX</a>) may not be available
unless both client and server are the latest version .  There are also
cases (e.g., <a href="#XXX">XXX</a>) where a
new feature will work but will run less efficiently if the client is
new and the server old.</p>

<p>There is <strong>no need</strong> to dump and reload your
repositories.  Subversion 1.6 can read repositories created by earlier
versions.  To upgrade an existing installation, just install the
newest libraries and binaries on top of the older ones.</p>

<p>Subversion 1.6 maintains API/ABI compatibility with earlier
releases, by only adding new functions, never removing old ones.  A
program written to the 1.0, 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 1.4 or 1.5 API can both compile
and run using 1.6 libraries.  However, a program written for 1.6
cannot necessarily compile or run against older libraries.</p>

<h3>Working Copy and Repository Filesystem Format Changes</h3>

<p>The working copy format has been upgraded.  This means that 1.5 and
older Subversion clients will <em>not</em> be able to work with
working copies produced by Subversion 1.6.  Working copies are <a
href="#wc-upgrades" >upgraded automatically</a>.</p>

<p>Similarly, the repository filesystem formats have changed, meaning
that 1.5 and older versions of Subversion tools that normally access
a repository directly (e.g. <tt>svnserve</tt>, <tt>mod_dav_svn</tt>,
<tt>svnadmin</tt>) won't be able to read a repository created by
Subversion 1.6.  But, repositories are <a href="#repos-upgrades"
><strong>not</strong> upgraded automatically</a>.</p>

<div class="h4" id="wc-upgrades" title="wc-upgrades">
<h4>Working Copy Upgrades</h4>

<p><strong>WARNING:</strong> if a Subversion 1.6 client encounters a
pre-1.6 working copy, it will <em>automatically</em> upgrade the
working copy format as soon as it touches it, making it unreadable by
older Subversion clients.  If you are using several versions of
Subversion on your machine, be careful about which version you use in
which working copy, to avoid accidentally upgrading a working copy.
(But note that this "auto upgrade" behavior does <em>not</em> occur
with the <a href="#repos-upgrades" >repositories</a>, only working
copies.)</p>

<p>If you accidentally upgrade a 1.5 working copy to 1.6, and wish to
downgrade back to 1.5, use the <a
href="http://svn.collab.net/repos/svn/trunk/tools/client-side/change-svn-wc-format.py"
><tt>change-svn-wc-format.py</tt></a> script.  See <a
href="http://subversion.tigris.org/faq.html#working-copy-format-change"
>this FAQ entry</a> for details, and run the script with the
<code>--help</code> option for usage instructions.</p>

<div class="h4" id="repos-upgrades" title="repos-upgrades">
<h4>Repository Upgrades</h4>

<p>The Subversion 1.6 server works with 1.5 and older repositories,
and it will <em>not</em> upgrade such repositories to 1.6 unless
specifically requested to via the
<strong><code>svnadmin&nbsp;upgrade</code></strong> command.  This means
that some of the new 1.6 features will not become available simply by
upgrading your server: you will also have to upgrade your
repositories.  (We decided not to auto-upgrade repositories because we
didn't want 1.6 to silently make repositories unusable by
1.5&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;that step should be a conscious decision on the
part of the repository admin.)</p>

<h3>Command Line Output Changes</h3>

</p>

<p>
  There are a few differences between directory and file
  externals.
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    The path to the file external must be in a working copy that is
    already checked out.  While directory externals can place the
    external directory at any depth and it will create any
    intermediate directories, file externals must be placed into a
    working copy that is already checked out.
  </li>
  <li>
    The file external's URL must be in the same repository as the URL
    that the file external will be inserted into; inter-repository
    file externals are not supported.
  </li>
  <li>
    While commits do not descend into a directory external, a commit
    in a directory containing a file external will commit any
    modifications to the file external.
  </li>
</ul>

<p>The differences between a normal versioned file and a file
external.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    File externals cannot be moved or deleted; the
    <tt>svn:externals</tt> property must be modified instead; however,
    file externals can be copied.
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Other facts.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    A file external shows up as a <tt>X</tt> in the switched status
    column.

<div class="h3" id="tree-conflicts" title="tree-conflicts">
<h3>Detection of tree conflicts (<em>client</em>)</h3>

<p>Subversion 1.6 recognizes a new kind of conflict, known as a
&quot;tree conflict&quot;. Such conflicts manifest at the level
of directory structure, rather than file content.</p>

<p>Situations now flagged as conflicts include deletions of locally
modified files, and incoming edits to locally deleted files. Files
and directories which are victims of a tree conflict cannot be
committed before the conflict is marked resolved.</p>

<p>Note that Subversion is still treating renames as a &quot;copy+delete&quot;
operation, so file renames causing tree conflicts can only be detected
in terms of file additions and deletions. Because of this, false positives
during tree conflict detection are possible.</p>

<p>To facilitate tree conflict detection, attempting to commit the
deletion of a file which has already been deleted in the HEAD revision
now causes an error. In Subversion 1.5, this was treated as a no-op,
potentially resulting in &quot;empty&quot; revisions which contained
no changes.</p>

<p>See the <a
href="http://svnbook.red-bean.com/nightly/en/svn.tour.treeconflicts.html"
>tree conflicts</a> section of the Subversion Book for details.</p>

<h3>Filesystem Storage Improvements</h3>

<p>Subversion 1.6 contains several improvements to both the Berkeley DB and FSFS
backends.  These are designed to improve storage space, and can result in
drastically smaller repositories.  These changes include:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="#rep-sharing"
      >Representation sharing</a></li>
  <li><a href="#fsfs-packing"
      >FSFS inode packing</a></li>
  <li><a href="#fsfs-memcached"
      >FSFS repositories: Support for Memcached</a></li>
  <li><a href="#bdb-reverse-deltas"
      >BDB repositories: Reverse deltas</a></li>
</ul>

<div class="h4" id="rep-sharing" title="rep-sharing">
<h4>Sharing multiple common representations
  (<em><a href="/issues/show_bug.cgi?id=2286">issue 2286</a></em>,
   <em>server</em>)</h4>
<p>XXX:When using many branches and merging between them often, it is common to
have files with similar lines of history which contain the exact same content.
In the past, Subversion has stored these files as deltas against previous
versions of the file.  Subversion 1.6 will now use existing representations in
the filesystem for duplicate storage.  Depending on the size of the repository,
and the degree of branching and merging, this can cause an up to 20% space
reduction for Berkeley DB repositories and a 15% reduction for FSFS
repositories.</p>

</div> <!-- rep-sharing -->

<div class="h4" id="fsfs-packing" title="fsfs-memcached">
<h4>FSFS repositories: Packing completed shards (<em>server</em>)</h4>

<p>Subversion 1.5 introduced the ability for FSFS repositories to be
<em><a href="svn_1.5_releasenotes.html#fsfs-sharding">sharded</a></em> into
multiple directories for revision and revprop files.  Subversion 1.6 takes
the sharding concept further, and allows full shard directories to be
<em>packed</em> into a single file.  By reducing internal fragmentation in
the filesystem, packed FSFS repositories have significant space savings
over their unpacked counterparts, especially repositories which contain
many small commits.  Using a one-file-per-shard approach also allows
Subversion to reduce disk I/O and better exploit operating system caches.
</p>

<p>To pack a repository, run <code>svnadmin pack</code> on the repository.
Once a repository has been packed, there is no migration path back to an
unpacked state, and it can only be read by Subversion 1.6 or greater
servers.</p>
