<h1>Subversion Issue Tracker</h1>

<h2>Issue Tracker Guidelines</h2>

<p>As Subversion continues to mature, and as it gains attention from
   new users, folks will inevitably find bugs in, or come up with
   enhancements that they would like to see made to, the software.
   The Subversion community welcomes such requests for enhancements
   and reports of bugs.  However, we ask that you follow a few
   guidelines with respect to the issue filing process.</p>

<div class="alert">
<p>Before filing an issue in the Issue Tracker, please:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Look through the <a
      href="http://subversion.tigris.org/issues/buglist.cgi?component=subversion&issue_status=UNCONFIRMED&issue_status=NEW&issue_status=STARTED&issue_status=REOPENED">existing
      issues</a> to determine if your concern has already been noted by
      someone else.</li>
  <li>Make sure that you've read the appropriate documentation (for
      example, the <a href="http://svnbook.red-bean.com/">Subversion
      book</a>) to verify that you are using the software
      appropriately, and to determine if any problems you are seeing are
      perhaps not real bugs.</li>
  <li>Send email to the development list (<a
      href="mailto:dev@subversion.tigris.org">dev@subversion.tigris.org</a>)
      fully describing the enhancement or bug that brought you here today.
      That will give the community a chance to ask questions of you, so that
      we can fully understand your concern.</li>
</ul>
</div>

<p>When mailing the development list with a concern, make sure that
   your e-mail describes your bug or enhancement fully.  Provide
   details about the versions of the relevant software (Subversion,
   Apache, neon, etc.) that you are using, about your operating
   system, and about any other thing that might seem pertinent to the
   issue.  If you can provide a script which consistently reproduces a
   problem, that can be incredibly helpful to those evaluating and/or
   working on your issue.</p>

<p>After mailing the development list, you should expect your concern
   to be addressed with relative immediacy.  That is, within a few
   days, you should get feedback on your mail.  If indeed you have
   found a new bug in Subversion, or if your enhancement request is
   feasible, you will likely be asked to return here and file a new
   issue in the Issue Tracker.</p>

<p>And so, with further ado, we give you (drumroll&hellip;) the

   Tracker</a>.</p>
