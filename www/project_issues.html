<div class="alert">
<p>The Subversion community welcomes requests for enhancements and
reports of bugs.  However, in an attempt to curb the number of issues
filed which are
  <ul>
   <li>duplicates of existing issues, 
   <li>invalid for some reason (e.g. user error), or
   <li>related not to Subversion, but perhaps to one of the libraries
       or utilities that Subversion depends upon,
  </ul>
we ask that before filing a new issue in the Issue Tracker, you first
send an e-mail to the development list (<a
href="mailto:dev@subversion.tigris.org">dev@subversion.tigris.org</a>)
fully describing the enhancement or bug that brought you here today.
That will give the community a chance to ask questions of you, so that
we can fully understand your concern.  If your concern is not
addressed with a relative immediacy, you will like be asked to return
here and file a real issue in the Issue Tracker.</p>

<p>Make sure that your e-mail (and subsequently filed issue) describe
your bug or enhancement fully.  Provide details about the versions of
the relevant software (Subversion, Apache, etc.) that you are using,
about your operating system, and any other details that might seem
pertinent to the issue.  If you can provide a shell script to
consistently reproduce a problem, that can be incredibly help to those
evaluating and/or working on your issue.</p>
