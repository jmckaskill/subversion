Subversion Inconveniences
</h1>
</center>

<p>

Subversion is in pre-Alpha state, and there are plenty of known bugs
(see the <a
href="http://subversion.tigris.org/servlets/ProjectIssues">Issues</a>
page for a complete list).  Frankly, you should probably read over all
the open issues.  But since you're probably not going to do that, we
list below some of the ones most likely to annoy you.

 <p>
   <li><b>Bug in nested wc deletions.</b><br>
   Ah, the joys and pains of versioning directories.  If you delete a
   directory, please commit the whole directory, not just one of the
   (deleted) subtrees.  Your working copy will thank you.
   <p>
   See <a href="http://subversion.tigris.org/issues/show_bug.cgi?id=387">
   Issue #387</a> for more details.
   </li>
  </p>

 <p>
   <li><b>Incomplete error messages</b><br>
   When you do see an error, it won't always be clear what the real
   problem is.  Subversion has a system for throwing and catching
   errors, but as errors are thrown up the callstack, not every
   routine attaches a coherent error message.  The error messages will
   improve over time.
   </li>

 <p>
   <li><b>Metadata props not yet fully working</b><br>
   Subversion allows you to attach arbitrary name/value pairs to files
   and directories;  right now, this feature works when talking to a
   local repository, but not yet over a network.  This bug is being
   actively worked on now.
