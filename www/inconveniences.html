Subversion Inconveniences
</h1>
</center>

<p>
Subversion is Alpha software, and there are plenty of known bugs
(see the <a href="http://subversion.tigris.org/project_tasks.html"
>Tasks</a> page for a detailed list).  Below are some of the problems
most likely to annoy new users.
</p>


<ol>
   <li><b>Charset conversion not yet supported on Win32</b><br>
   <p>Charset encoding (i18n) conversion is not yet supported on
      Win32, due to problems with our portability libraries, apr
      and apr-util.  There is no issue associated with this, but 
      it is being actively worked on and should be fixed soon.
      Meanwhile, stick with 7-bit ascii on Windows.</p>
   </li>

   <p>

   <li><b>Charset conversion failure mode too extreme</b><br>
   <p>If Subversion cannot convert log data to your local charset
      encoding, it will (currently) just show "[unconvertible data]"
      for the entire unconverted log message.  This is lossier than
      necessary.  There are even some revisions in the Subversion
      repository itself that exhibit this behavior when the client
      locale is ISO-8859-1 (Latin-1).</p>
   <p>See <a href="http://subversion.tigris.org/issues/show_bug.cgi?id=807"
      >Issue #807</a> for more details.</p>
   </li>

   <p>

   <li><b>Repository deadlocks</b><br>
   <p>If an svn client is directly accessing a repository via a
      file:/// url and is interrupted, or crashes, (or if httpd
      crashes), the repository is likely to be left in a 'wedged'
      state.  You'll need to run Berkeley DB's 
      '<tt>db_recover&nbsp;-ve&nbsp;-h&nbsp;repos/db</tt>' to
      unwedge the repository.  Make sure you shut down httpd before
      doing this.</p>
   <p>See <a href="http://subversion.tigris.org/issues/show_bug.cgi?id=739"
      >Issue #739</a> for more details.</p>
   </li>
</ol>
