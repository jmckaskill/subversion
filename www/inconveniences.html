Subversion Inconveniences
</h1>
</center>

<p>

Subversion is in pre-Alpha state, and there are plenty of known bugs
(see the <a
href="http://subversion.tigris.org/servlets/ProjectIssues">Issues</a>
page for a complete list).  Frankly, you should probably read over all
the open issues.  But since you're probably not going to do that, we
list below some of the ones most likely to annoy you.

 <p>
   <li><b>Bug in nested wc deletions.</b><br>
   Ah, the joys and pains of versioning directories.  If you delete a
   directory, please commit the whole directory, not just one of the
   (deleted) subtrees.  Your working copy will thank you.
   <p>
   See <a href="http://subversion.tigris.org/issues/show_bug.cgi?id=387">
   Issue #387</a> for more details.
   </li>
  </p>

 <p>
   <li><b>Incomplete error messages</b><br>
   When you do see an error, it won't always be clear what the real
   problem is.  Subversion has a system for throwing and catching
   errors, but as errors are thrown up the callstack, not every
   routine attaches a coherent error message.  The error messages will
   improve over time.
   </li>
 </p>
 
 <p>
   <li><b>Property changes to directories require updating first</b><br>
   If you're going to commit a property change made to a directory,
   you'll need to update that directory first, to bring it to the
   youngest (head) revision, otherwise Subversion will reject the
   commit.  This rejection is a temporary workaround for a larger
   issues <a
   href="http://subversion.tigris.org/issues/show_bug.cgi?id=463">Issue
   #463</a> and <a
   href="http://subversion.tigris.org/issues/show_bug.cgi?id=530">Issue
   #530</a>
   </li>
 </p>

 <p>
   <li><b>Repeatedly adding/deleting multiple files in same dir needs update</b><br>
   If you want to add or delete entries in a dir -- in a repeated
   series of commits -- you must update between the commits, or the server
   will reject your second commit.  This is also part of issues <a
   href="http://subversion.tigris.org/issues/show_bug.cgi?id=463">Issue
   #463</a> and <a
   href="http://subversion.tigris.org/issues/show_bug.cgi?id=530">Issue
   #530</a>.
   </li>
