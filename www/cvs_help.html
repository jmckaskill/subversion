Repository:</FONT>
</B><FONT SIZE="1"></FONT></P>
<P>
To access the CVS source code repository use the following CVSROOT: 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b><tt>:pserver:guest@cvs.tigris.org:/cvs</tt></b>
</P>
<p>
You may also use the login "guest" with password "guest" to gain read-only
CVS access.  If you have been given write access to the CVS repository,
then replace "guest@cvs.tigris.org" with your own login (e.g.,
"my_login@cvs.tigris.org") and use your own tigris user password.
</p>

<p>
The module you should checkout is "subversion/src".  That is the top-level module
that contain the entire source code tree for the Inversion project.
</p>

<P>
The way most people contribute changes is to email a "patch" to one of the
"module owners".  These are developers who are
responsible for certain sections of the code (called modules).  There is a
list of module owners <a
href="http://subversion.tigris.org/project_memebers.html">here</a>.
Once a module owner sees your contribibution, he or she will review it and
integrate it into the source code repository.
