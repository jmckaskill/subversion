<h1>Roadmap</h1>

<!-- ******************************************************************** -->

<h3>The Future</h3>

<p>This list is a rough prioritization of planned feature additions,
based on an ever-changing consensus of the Subversion developer
community.  Because this is a volunteer open-source project, it's hard
to predict exact dates or timetables for these new features.  At most,
we can express dependencies and predict the order in which things will
be worked on.  The best way to track development is to <a
href="/servlets/ProjectMailingListList">subscribe</a> to the
developer's mailing list.</p>


<ul>

<li><b>Subversion 1.2 Goals:</b>
  <ul>
    <li>optional locking (reserved checkouts).</li>
  </ul>
</li>
   
<li><b>Medium-term Goals:</b>
  <ul>
    <li>true rename support (not based on copy/delete)</li>
    <li>merge tracking (describes a whole class of problems)</li>
    <li>repository-level ACLs</li>
  </ul>
</li>


<li><b>Other Long-term Goals</b>
  <ul>
    <li>SQL repository back-end</li>
    <li>rewrite of working-copy library</li>
    <li>broader WebDAV/deltaV compatibility</li>
    <li>pluggable client-side diff programs</li>
    <li>progressive multi-lingual support</li>
  </ul>
</li>

</ul>


<h3>Completed Subversion Releases</h3>

<p>A page documenting the pre-1.0 releases of Subversion can be found
<a href="project_status.html">here</a>.  In particular, if you're
trying to upgrade a very old repository, read the <a
href="http://svn.collab.net/repos/svn/trunk/notes/repos_upgrade_HOWTO">
repository upgrade HOWTO</a>.</p>

<p>To see a summary of major changes in each Subversion release, read
