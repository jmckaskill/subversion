<p>We are putting together a coalition of developers interested
in building a better version control system for the open source
community.  The following members are already working toward that
goal.  We welcome your participation.
</p>

<p>
To get involved, join the developer's mailing list by sending email to
<a href="dev-subscribe@subversion.tigris.org">dev-subscribe@subversion.tigris.org</a>. 
</p>

<P>
The first thing you should do when you join the list is to post an
introduction message that tells the group:
</P>

<ul>
<li>who you are, </li>
<li>your interest in version control,</li>
<li>the role you would like to play in the project
(e.g., do you want to just discuss ideas, write code, do design, or
be an early users?), and</li>
<li>the rough level of effort you expect to put (e.g., mainly lurking,
a few postings a week, a few evenings, several hours a week, this is
part of your full-time job).</li>
</ul>

<P>
See the mailing list <a
href="http://subversion.tigris.org/subversion-dev/">archive</a> to see how
others have introduced themselves.
