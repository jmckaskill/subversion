I've left svn_client_move2 with force--I just couldn't come up with a
replacement that was under 30 characters long. :) -Fitz

They're now macros, and since they're shared across 3 different
libraries, I think they should stay. -Fitz

Not sure what to do about that. -Fitz

Karl says:

"I think this may be based on a misunderstanding what happened in
r13387.  No error's number changed.  A new error code was added
(SVN_ERR_FS_UNSUPPORTED_FORMAT), and a comment was added to another
error code (SVN_ERR_REPOS_UNSUPPORTED_VERSION) explaining the
relationship between the two.

This is not a case of a new error obsoleting an old one.  The two
errors are not the same.  The whole purpose of the change is to allow
us to distinguish repository format problems from fs format problems
in the future."
