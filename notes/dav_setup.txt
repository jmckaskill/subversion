                                DAV SETUP
                                =========
                                   or, 
   how Subversion developers can set up Apache/mod_dav/mod_dav_svn locally.


1.  Checkout the "httpd-2.0" cvs module from apache.org.  Put it
    whereever you wish;  it's an independent project.

      cvs -d :pserver:anoncvs@apache.org:/home/cvspublic login
         (password 'anoncvs')

      cvs -d :pserver:anoncvs@apache.org:/home/cvspublic co httpd-2.0

2.  cd httpd-2.0/srclib/, and checkout the "apr" and "apr-util"
    modules into this directory:

      cvs -d :pserver:anoncvs@apache.org:/home/cvspublic co apr
      cvs -d :pserver:anoncvs@apache.org:/home/cvspublic co apr-util

3.  At the top of the httpd-2.0 tree, run "buildconf".

4.  ./configure --enable-dav --enable-so --prefix=/usr/local/apache2

     The first arg says to build mod_dav.
     The second arg says to enable (and build everything) as shared libs.
     The third arg is where you will ultimately install apache.

5.  make && make install

6.  Go back into your subversion working copy and run ./autogen.sh if
    you need to.  Then run
 
      ./configure --with-apxs=/usr/local/apache2/bin/apxs
      make

    This argument tells subversion to build mod_dav_svn, and where to
    find the required information to do so.

    Note:  do *not* configure subversion with "--disable-shared"!
    mod_dav_svn *must* be built as a shared library.

7.  After compiling all of subversion as shared libs, enter these
    directories one at a time and run `make install`:

           libsvn_fs
           libsvn_subr
           libsvn_delta
           mod_dav_svn

    This will copy the shared libraries into /usr/local/lib.

8.  cd into /usr/local/apache2, or wherever your "httpd.conf" file was
    installed, and add these lines to the *bottom* of httpd.conf:

          <Location /svn/repos>
             dav svn
             svn /absolute/path/to/repository
          </Location>

9.  Now go ahead and fire up apache 2.0, using the 'apachectl' script,
    whereever it was installed:

           ./apachectl start

10. Finally, try doing a network checkout from the repository:

          svn co http://localhost/svn/repos -d wc


There now, wasn't that easy?  :)
