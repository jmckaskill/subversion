This is a template for offering people commit access in the contrib/
area.  Just replace "J. Random" with the offeree, and "XXXXX" with the
name of their contribution.  Thanks to Garrett Rooney for his original
mail to Ray Miller regarding p42svn, on which this template is based.

Subject: subversion commit access for XXXXX

J. Random,

I discussed it with the rest of the Subversion Committers, and we'd
like to offer you limited commit access to the Subversion repository
for your work on XXXXX.  All of us think that having it in the tree
would give it a wider audience, which is always a good thing, both for
finding bugs and for finding new developers to help out.

Assuming you accept, you'll be able to create a XXXXX directory in the
contrib/ subdirectory of the Subversion tree, and maintain XXXXX there
from now on.  Your commit access to the repository would be limited to
that subdirectory, so for any changes outside of that area you would
have to have the patches reviewed by someone with full commit access.
This limitation isn't actually enforced by any technical means (we've
always been too lazy to set up hook scripts or mod_authz_svn).  It's
enforced only by social convention, so please be careful not to
inadvertantly commit any changes outside the XXXXX subdirectory.

Note that we decided to put XXXXX in contrib/ simply because at the
moment you would be its only active maintainer -- whereas placing it
in the tools/ subdirectory would imply some level of official support,
and we prefer to have multiple active maintainers before doing that.
In the future, if more people get involved with XXXXX, we can look at
moving it into tools/.

If all this is okay with you, please send us a username and password;
the username should be the same as your subversion.tigris.org
username, and the password can be plaintext or crypted.  Send to

   Ben Collins-Sussman <sussman@collab.net>
   C. Michael Pilato <cmpilato@collab.net>
   Sander Striker <striker@apache.org> 
   Greg Stein <gstein@collab.net>
   Karl Fogel <kfogel@collab.net>

and one of them will set you up with commit access.  If they forget to
add you to the COMMITTERS file, feel free to do it yourself.  Then
create contrib/XXXXX/ and start committing!

Thanks,
-Your Name Here
