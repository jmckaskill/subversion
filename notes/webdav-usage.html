    <h1>Use of WebDAV in Subversion</h1>

    <p>
      This document details how WebDAV is used within the
      <a href="http://subversion.tigris.org/">Subversion
      product</a>. Specifically, how the client side interfaces with
      <a href="http://www.webdav.org/neon/">Neon</a> to generate
      WebDAV requests over the wire, and what the
      server must do to map incoming WebDAV requests into operations
      against the Subversion repository. Note that the server side is
      implemented as an
      <a href="http://httpd.apache.org/">Apache 2.0</a> module,
      operating as a back-end for its mod_dav functionality.
    </p>
    <p>
      This document heavily refers to the
      <a href="http://subversion.tigris.org/svn-design.html">Subversion
	design document</a> and the
      <a href="http://www.webdav.org/deltav/">latest Delta-V protocol
	draft</a>. Details of those documents will <em>not</em> be
      replicated here.
    </p>

    <hr width="80&#37;">
    <h2>Basic Concepts</h2>
    <p>
      Subversion uses a tree-based format to describe a change set
      against the repository. This tree is constructed on the client
      side to describe the change. It is then marshalled to the
      server, reconstructed, and applied against the
      repository. However, WebDAV uses a sequence of changes. As a
      result, we must map from the tree form to a sequence of WebDAV
      requests, send them over the wire, then reconstruct the tree
      form on the server for application to the repository.
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      Actually, the repository no longer uses the "standard tree
      interface", so the DAV module on the server does not need to
      reconstruct a tree. Instead, it can apply the changes in
      (effectively) a random-access manner over the repository.
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      Subversion also provides properties on files, directories, and
      even the abstract concept of a revision. Each of the operations
      involving properties will be mapped directly to WebDAV
      properties, which are manipulated with the <code>PROPFIND</code>
      and <code>PROPPATCH</code> HTTP methods. To enable properties on
      abstract revisions, the Subversion Apache module will publish a
      URL namespace containing resources for each revision. The
      per-revision properties will be maintained on these resources.
    </p>
    <p>
      Subversion specifies that the server will compute deltas between
      two revisions (these deltas are complete <em>tree</em> deltas;
      we aren't talking about a simple text delta). Presumably, the
      server can create the delta much more efficiently than a client
      performing a sequence of <code>PROPFIND</code> requests. This
      feature will be implemented using a custom WebDAV "report". If
      the client is performing an actual update, then a series of
      <code>GET</code> operations will be performed to fetch the files
      which have changed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tags and branches are handled through the WebDAV
      <code>LABEL</code> and <code>COPY</code> methods as appropriate.
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <strong>Note:</strong> we aren't entirely sure what form our
      labels will take. We may support labels-via-copy, or we may go
      with a classic "apply a label to a revision" where the labels
      live outside of the repository tree structure. Labels-via-copy
      are no extra work. Applying labels to a revision will most
      likely be implemented using some <cite>baseline</cite> magic.
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote>
      <strong>Note:</strong> copies will most likely be implemented
      with the <code>VERSION-CONTROL</code> method rather than
      <code>COPY</code>. This is still under a bit of
      investigation. The text below may still refer to
      <code>COPY</code>, but it will be updated soon.
      <p>
	The basic issue here is that a <code>COPY</code> will
	construct a new version history. We want to retain the fact
	that the new copy's was derived from elsewhere, and to be able
	to see the history prior to the copy. This implies sharing the 
	version history between the copies.
      </p>
    </blockquote>

    <hr width="80&#37;">
    <h2>Subversion Projects as URLs</h2>
    <p>
      The very first concept to define is how a project is exposed to
      the client. Subversion will expose all projects as URLs on a
      server. The files and subdirectories under this project will be
      exposed through the URL namespace.
    </p>
    <p>
      For example, let us assume that we have a project named
      "example". And let us say that this project will be exposed at
      the URL: <code>http://subversion.tigris.org/example/</code>.
    </p>
    <p>
      This mapping will be set up through a set of configuration
      parameters for the Apache HTTPD server (which is hosting the
      Subversion code and the particular project in question). The
      configuration might look like:
    </p>
    <blockquote>
<pre>&lt;Location /example&gt;
    DAV svn
    SVNPath /home/svn-projects/example
&lt;/Location&gt;</pre>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      Files and directories within the project will be directly mapped
      to the URL namespace. For example, if the project contains a
      file "file.c" in a subdirectory "sub", then the URL for that
      file will be
      <code>http://subversion.tigris.org/example/sub/file.c</code>.
    </p>

    <hr width="80&#37;">
    <h2>Committing a Change Set</h2>
    <p>
      Change sets are modeled using the "activity" concept from
      WebDAV. An activity can be viewed as a transaction for a set of
      resources.
    </p>
    <h3>Creating the activity</h3>
    <p>
      When the initial checkout is performed, Subversion will fetch
      the <code>DAV:activity-collection-set</code> property for each
      collection. This property lists all of the locations on the
      server where an activity may be created. The first of these
      locations will be stored on the client for use during the commit 
      process.
    </p>
    <p>
      At commit time, the Subversion client will retrieve the stored
      <code>DAV:activity-collection-set</code> property value. Next,
      the client will generate a UUID (a unique value) to use for the
      activity's location. Finally, the client will issue a
      <code>MKACTIVITY</code> method request, where the Request-URL is
      composed from the activity location and the UUID. This request
      will construct an activity to hold all of the changes for the
      commit.
    </p>
    <p>Abbreviated summary:</p>
    <dl>
      <dt>At checkout time:</dt>
      <dd>
	Request: <code>PROPFIND</code> for
	<code>DAV:activity-collection-set</code>
	<br>
	Response: <code>http://www.example.com/$svn/act/</code>
      </dd>
      <dt>At commit time:</dt>
      <dd>
	Request: <code>MKACTIVITY</code>
	<code>http://www.example.com/$svn/act/01234567-89ab-cdef-0123-456789abcdef</code>
	<br>
	Response: 201 (Created)
      </dd>
    </dl>
    <p>
      The (advanced) <code>CHECKOUT</code> method has a way to specify 
      an activity upon checkout. This feature will be used to
      associate all items with the newly-created activity.
    </p>
    
    <h3>Mapping changes to WebDAV</h3>
    <p>
      A change set in Subversion is specified with a "tree delta" (see
      the SVN design for more details on the changes that can be
      placed into a tree delta). The tree delta will be unravelled
      into a set of requests. These requests will be one of the
      following forms:
    </p>
    <dl>
      <dt>Delete file/directory</dt>
      <dd>
	This will be mapped to a <code>DELETE</code> operation. The
	parent of the target's version resource will be checked out
	using the <code>CHECKOUT</code> method (into the current
	activity). The target (name) will be deleted from the
	resulting working collection using the <code>DELETE</code>
	method.

	<p></p>
      </dd>

      <dt>New file</dt>
      <dd>
	This is modeled by performing a <code>CHECKOUT</code> on the
	version resource of the target's parent collection. The new
	file is created within the resulting working collection with a
	<code>PUT</code>, or a directory can be created there using a
	<code>MKCOL</code> request. Properties will be applied using
	<code>PROPFIND</code>

	<p></p>
      </dd>

      <dt>New file/directory, previous ancestory</dt>
      <dd>
	A tree delta can specify that a file/directory originates as a
	copy of another file/dir. This copy may be further modified by
	additional elements the tree delta.

	<p>
	  This change will be modeled by performing a
	  <code>CHECKOUT</code> on the version resource of the parent
	  collection which will contain the new resource. The
	  <code>VERSION-CONTROL</code> method will create a new
	  version-controlled resource (VCR) within the working
	  collection, with the VCR's <code>DAV:checked-in</code>
	  property referring to the ancestor's version resource.
	</p>
	<blockquote>
	  <strong>Note:</strong> this might not be possible because it 
	  would appear that VCRs are not allowed to be children of
	  working collections.
	  <br>
	  <em>Investigating...</em>
	  <p>
	    Hmm. We might actually need to use sub-baselines for each
	    collection version. In DeltaV, collection versions refer
	    to version histories. In SVN, our collections refer to
	    specific version resources (and we bubble up). A set of
	    references to version resources is a baseline. That might
	    be our answer to the "collection versions refer to version
	    resources" and the "VCR within a working collection"
	    issues.
	  </p>
	</blockquote>
	<blockquote>
	  <em>(obsolete text)</em>
	  <br>
	  The resource created by the <code>COPY</code> will
	  become a new working resource, thus becoming a target for
	  additional changes.
	</blockquote>
      </dd>

      <dt>Replace file</dt>
      <dd>
	This is modeled with a <code>CHECKOUT</code> on the target's
	version resource, followed by a <code>PUT</code> to the
	resulting working resource.

	<blockquote>
	  Note: in an older conceptual model, it was possible to
	  replace a file with another file/directory (e.g. copy a file
	  over the top of another and track its ancestry). This is no
	  longer done as a single operation, but is now a
	  <em>delete</em> followed by a <em>add</em>.
	</blockquote>
      </dd>

      <dt>Replace directory</dt>
      <dd>
	In Subversion terms, "replace directory" means that additions, 
	deletions, and other changes will occur <em>within</em> the
	directory. Each of these changes are modeled individually, and 
	the change to the directory is performed
	implicitly. Therefore, this "change" has no particular mapping 
	into WebDAV.

	<blockquote>
	  Note: in an older conceptual model, it was possible to
	  replace a directory with another file/directory (e.g. copy a
	  directory over the top of another and track its
	  ancestry). This is no longer done as a single operation, but
	  is now a <em>delete</em> followed by a <em>add</em>.
	</blockquote>
      </dd>

      <dt>Property delta</dt>
      <dd>
	A property delta (against a file or directory) maps directly
	to a <code>PROPPATCH</code> in WebDAV terms. The target's
	version resource will be checked out using
	<code>CHECKOUT</code> and the <code>PROPPATCH</code> will be
	applied to the resulting working resource.
      </dd>
    </dl>

    <p>
      Note that file "moves" are modeled using <code>COPY</code> to
      establish the linkage between the new/old files/directories,
      followed by a <code>DELETE</code> to remove the old
      file/directory.
    </p>

    <h3>Final Commit</h3>
    <p>
      The final action of the commit process is to issue a
      <code>MERGE</code> request to the Subversion server, specifying
      that the activity (created earlier) be checked in and the
      corresponding version-controlled resources be updated to refer
      to the new version resources.
    </p>

    <h3>Example</h3>
    <p class="comment">
      <strong>Warning:</strong> this section has not been updated to
      reflect some recent changes to the SVN-to-DAV mapping. Consider
      it out of date until this warning is removed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Consider the following set of operations and its corresponding
      tree delta (taken from the SVN design document):
    </p>
    <ol type=1 start=1>
      <li>rename <code>/dir1/dir2</code> to <code>/dir1/dir4</code>,</li>
      <li>rename <code>/dir1/dir3</code> to <code>/dir1/dir2</code>, and</li>
      <li>move <code>file3</code> from <var>/dir1/dir4</var> to <var>/dir1/dir2</var>.</li>
    </ol>
<pre>&lt;tree-delta&gt;
  &lt;replace name='dir1'&gt;
    &lt;directory&gt;
      &lt;tree-delta&gt;
        &lt;replace name='dir2'&gt;
          &lt;directory ancestor='/dir1/dir3'&gt;         (1)
            &lt;tree-delta&gt;
              &lt;new name='file3'&gt;                    (2)
                &lt;file ancestor='/dir1/dir2/file3'/&gt;
              &lt;/new&gt;
            &lt;/tree-delta&gt;
          &lt;/directory&gt;
        &lt;/replace&gt;
        &lt;delete name='dir3'/&gt;                       (3)
        &lt;new name='dir4'&gt;                           (4)
          &lt;directory ancestor='/dir1/dir2'&gt;
            &lt;tree-delta&gt;
              &lt;delete name='file3'/&gt;                (5)
            &lt;/tree-delta&gt;
          &lt;/directory&gt;
        &lt;/new&gt;
      &lt;/tree-delta&gt;
    &lt;/directory&gt;
  &lt;/replace&gt;
&lt;/tree-delta&gt;
</pre>

    <p>
      Walking through this delta, we map out the WebDAV requests
      listed below. The numbers in the above delta roughly correspond
      to the numbered entries below. The correspondence is not exact
      because a specific, resulting behavior is typically based on a
      combination of a few elements in the delta.
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>
	The <code>&lt;directory ancestor="/dir1/dir3"&gt;</code>
	specifies that we are overwriting <code>/dir1/dir2</code> with 
	<code>/dir1/dir3</code>.
	<p>
	  <code>CHECKOUT&nbsp;/dir1/dir2/</code><br>
	  <i>(returns a working resource URL for the directory)</i>
	</p>
	<p>
	  <code>COPY&nbsp;/dir1/dir3/</code><br>
	  <code>Destination:&nbsp;http://www.example.com/$svn/wr/.../</code><br>
	  <code>Overwrite:&nbsp;T</code>
	</p>
      </li>
      <li>
	<code>/dir1/dir2/file3</code> is new (since we just overwrote
	the original <code>dir2</code> directory), and originates from
	<code>/dir1/dir2/file3</code>. Thus, we simply
	<code>COPY</code> the file into the target directory's working 
	resource:
	<p>
	  <code>COPY&nbsp;/dir1/dir2/file3</code><br>
	  <code>Destination:&nbsp;http://www.example.com/$svn/wr/.../file3</code>
	</p>
      </li>
      <li>
	<code>CHECKOUT&nbsp;/dir1/dir3/</code><br>
	<i>(returns a working resource URL for the directory)</i>
	<p>
	  <code>DELETE&nbsp;/$svn/wr/.../</code>
	</p>
      </li>
      <li>
	We are going to  creating a new subdirectory (<code>dir4</code>) in the
	<code>/dir1</code> directory. Since we don't have
	<code>/dir1</code> checked out yet, we do so:
	<p>
	  <code>CHECKOUT&nbsp;/dir1/</code><br>
	  <i>(returns a working resource URL for the directory)</i>
	</p>
	<p>
	  And now we copy the right directory into the new working
	  resource:
	</p>
	<p>
	  <code>COPY&nbsp;/dir1/dir2/</code><br>
	  <code>Destination:&nbsp;http://www.example.com/$svn/wr/.../dir4/</code>
	</p>
      </li>
      <li>
	The <code>COPY</code> created a complete set of working
	resources on the server, so we simply delete the part that we
	don't want:
	<p>
	  <code>DELETE:&nbsp;/$svn/wr/.../dir4/file3</code>
	</p>
      </li>
    </ol>

    <hr width="80&#37;">
    <h2>URL Layout</h2>
    <p>
      The Subversion server exposes repositories at user-defined URLs. For
      example, the "foo" repository might be located at
      <code>http://www.example.com/foo/</code>. However, the server
      also requires a number of other resources to be exposed for
      proper operation. These additional resources will be associated
      with each repository in a location under the main repository
      URL. By default, this location is "<code>$svn</code>". It may be 
      changed by using the <code>SVNSpecialURI</code> directive:
      </p>
    <blockquote>
<pre>&lt;Location /foo&gt;
    DAV svn
    SVNPath /home/svn-projects/foo
    SVNSpecialURI .special
&lt;/Location&gt;</pre>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      Underneath the location specified by
      <code>SVNSpecialURI</code>, we will expose several
      collections. Assuming we use the default of "<code>$svn</code>",
      the collections are:
    </p>
    <dl>
      <dt><code>$svn/act/</code></dt>
      <dd>
	This area is where activity resources are created. The client
	will pick a unique name within this collection and issue a
	<code>MKACTIVITY</code> for that URL. The client will then use 
	the activity in further interactions.
	<p>
	  No methods are allowed on the <code>$svn/act/</code> URL.
	</p>
	<blockquote>
	  Note: actually, we may want to allow a <code>PROPFIND</code> 
	  with a <code>Depth:&nbsp;1</code> header to allow clients to 
	  enumerate the current activities.
	</blockquote>
	<p>
	  Only a subset of methods are allowed on the activities
	  within the collection. They are: <code>PROPFIND</code>,
	  <code>MERGE</code>, and <code>DELETE</code>.
	</p>
	<p>
	  Per the Delta-V specification, all activity resources will
	  have a <code>DAV:resourcetype</code> of
	  <code>DAV:activity</code>.
	</p>
      </dd>
      
      <dt><code>$svn/his/</code></dt>
      <dd>
	This collection contains the version history resources for
	files and directories in a project. Its internal layout is
	completely server-defined. Clients will receive URLs into this 
	collection (or a subcollection) from various responses.
	<p>
	  No methods are allowed on the <code>$svn/his/</code> URL.
	</p>
	<p>
	  Internally, the URL namespace is laid out with URLs of the
	  following form:
	</p>
	<blockquote>
	  <code>$svn/his/<var>node-id</var></code>
	</blockquote>
	<p>
	  The <var>node-id</var> is an internal value
	  that Subversion uses to reference individual files and
	  directories. This <var>node-id</var> is a single integer
	  defined by the Subversion repository. Note that this is a an 
	  undotted node id, which is the base for the entire history
	  of a given node in the repository.
	</p>
	<p>
	  The <code>DAV:resourcetype</code> of the <var>node-id</var>
	  collection is <code>DAV:version-history</code>.

    <dl>
      <dt><code>DAV:comment</code></dt>
      <dd>
	This is the standard (dead) property for specifying a checkin
	comment. This properties will be attached to the project
	revision resources in <i class="comment">where??</i>
	<p></p>
      </dd>
      <dt><code>DAV:creator-displayname</code></dt>
      <dd>
	This is a (dead) property that is generated from Subversion's
	concept of the "user" who made a particular change. It is a
	read-only property since it is stored on (immutable) version
	resources and version-controlled resources.
	<p></p>
      </dd>
      <dt><code>DAV:checkin-date</code></dt>
      <dd>
	This is a read-only live property maintained by the server on
	version resources. Strictly speaking, it is only maintained on 
	the project-revision resources, but the Delta-V specification
	states that it is exposed on every version resource.

    </dl>
    <p>
      The history for a specified file will be generated using the
      <code>REPORT</code> method and a
      <code>DAV:property-report</code> report. A typical history will
      fetch the three properties mentioned above for each version of
      the file/directory.
    </p>
    <p>
      Based on the client design, it may be important to specify other 
      read-only live properties for information about versions. For
      examply, how many lines were added/removed in a particular
      checkin for a file? Creating these live properties will be quite 
      straight-forward, and driven by the client design over time.

      Note: if we do this, however, then we'd end up tying the client
      to the server. Of course, if the client were run against another 
      DeltaV server which didn't report these properties, then we'd
      simply not display them in the UI. (e.g. graceful degradation of 
      functionality)

    <h2>Fetching Status and Updates</h2>
    <p class="comment">
      <strong>Warning:</strong> this section is out of date. The
      mechanisms for status and update are quite a bit different now,
      with the introduction of the <cite>editor</cite> concept.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Subversion design discusses the use of skeleton deltas and
      deltas to return status and update information (see
      <code>ra_get_status()</code> and
      <code>ra_get_update()</code>). However, the appropriate
      mechanism to use in WebDAV is a <code>PROPFIND</code> on a file,
      directory, or tree to fetch the <code>DAV:target</code>
      property. The <code>DAV:target</code> property will specify the
      URL of the version the version-selector is referring to. If the
      URL matches the value stored in the working copy, then no
      changes were made in the repository.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is presumed that the working copy library can detect local
      modifications to a file, and local tree structure changes. The
      important part is when the local library needs to consult the
      server to look for server-side changes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Updates are handled similarly, then followed by a sequence of
      <code>GET</code> operations to fetch the new files.
    </p>
    <p>
      <code>GET</code> (and <code>PUT</code>) operations will transfer 
      content in a "diff" format when possible. The mechanics of this
      will follow the Internet Draft, titled
      <a href="http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-mogul-http-delta-07.txt">Delta Encoding in HTTP</a>.
    </p>

    <h3>Entity Tags (etags)</h3>
    <p class="comment">
      <strong>Warning:</strong> this section is out of date. We need
      to update this section on how we'll be fetching the etags during
      a checkout/update.
    </p>
    <p>
      Etags are required to be unique across all versions of a
      resource. Luckily, this
      is very easy for a version control system. Each etag will be
      simply be the repository's <em>node-id</em> for the resource.
    </p>
    <p>
      Etags are used to generate diffs, following the guidelines in
      the aforementioned draft:
      <a href="http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-mogul-http-delta-07.txt">Delta Encoding in HTTP</a>.
      The problem then becomes how to get the etag for each file and
      directory revision stored on the client. During a
      <em>checkout</em> or <em>update</em> process, this is easy: the
      etag is provided in the HTTP response headers for each
      file retrieved. If etags are needed for directories, then they
      can be retrieved via <code>PROPFIND</code> (or possibly through
      a <code>REPORT</code> or during a sequence of
      <code>PROPFIND</code>s to traverse the server).
    </p>
    <p>
      The other part of the problem is getting the etag after a
      <em>commit</em> has occurred. The <code>MERGE</code> response
      provides a way to request properties from the version resources
      which are created as part of the checkin of the activity. The
      etag (and other properties) can be fetched using that mechanism.

    <h2>Tags and Branches</h2>
    <p class="comment">
      <strong>Warning:</strong> this section is out of date. How to do
      a copy is still up in the air, and we won't be using
      <code>DAV:auto-version</code>. The label concept is also a bit
      unknown. Then... all of this feeds into the possible use of
      baselines.
    </p>
    <p>
      The current Subversion design specification is not entirely
      clear on how tagging and branching will be performed. For the
      most part, all branching will be handled by copying source trees 
      to another location in the repository.
    </p>
    <p>
      <small>
	Note: the copies are actually by reference, rather than a
	complete duplication of the source.
      </small>
    </p>
    <p>
      Copies are handled just like a regular commit. An activity is
      created with <code>MKACTIVITY</code>, a working resource is
      created via <code>CHECKOUT</code> (for the target directory),
      and then a <code>COPY</code> is performed. The activity is then
      merged back into the repository with a <code>MERGE</code>
      request.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Note: we may be able to simplify all of this by simply
	assuming that <code>DAV:auto-version</code> is set and doing a 
	single <code>COPY</code> operation to the target area. Some
	investigation/thought is needed here.</i>
    </p>
    <h3>Tags/Labels</h3>
    <p>
      Subversion does not have any specific design yet for tagging or
      labeling specific revisions of the repository. Presumably, this
      would be performed by the client through some kind of property
      operation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Whatever the client/server ends up using for its design, all
      labeling requests will be mapped into <code>PROPFIND</code> and
      <code>LABEL</code> requests. The former for label discovery
      (read the <code>DAV:label-name-set</code> property), and the
      latter for applying, changing, and removing labels from
      versions.
    </p>
    <p>
      As mentioned before, we expose properties for the abstract
      concept of a revision. Those resources could be used for applying
      label information to the entire repository, rather than on a
      per-file basis. The exact needs here will be dependent upon the
      model chosen by the server to represent the different types of
      labels and how they can be applied to the
      repository. Nevertheless, the mapping should be straight
      forward.
    </p>

    <h2>Server Requirements</h2>
    <p class="comment">
      <strong>Warning:</strong> this section is out of date. The
      DeltaV draft has gone through a number of revisions, and our use
      of DeltaV has changed some.
    </p>

    <h3>DAV Methods</h3>
    <p>
      The server will need to implement the following WebDAV methods
      for proper operation:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><code>MKACTIVITY</code></li>
      <li><code>CHECKOUT</code></li>
      <li><code>PROPPATCH</code></li>
      <li><code>PROPFIND</code></li>
      <li><code>DELETE</code></li>
      <li><code>COPY</code></li>
      <li><code>MERGE</code></li>
      <li><code>REPORT</code></li>
      <li><code>LABEL</code></li>
      <li><code>VERSION-CONTROL</code></li>
      <li><code>BASELINE-CONTROL</code></li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      The following "core versioning" methods are not required by
      Subversion at this time:
      <code>CHECKIN</code>,
      <code>UNCHECKOUT</code>,
      and
      <code>UPDATE</code>.
      The following "advanced versioning" methods are not required by
      Subversion at this time:
      <code>MKWORKSPACE</code>.
    </p>

    <h3>DAV Properties</h3>
    <p>
      All of the "core versioning" properties will be implemented:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><code>DAV:creator-displayname</code></li>
      <li><code>DAV:comment</code></li>
      <li><code>DAV:target</code></li>
      <li><code>DAV:auto-version</code> is set to <code>F</code></li>
      <li>
	<code>DAV:version-name</code> is simply the (global) revision
	number
      </li>
      <li><code>DAV:version</code></li>
      <li>
	<code>DAV:predecessor-set</code>
	<br>
	<i>
	  Note: the Subversion design document is not clear on the
	  mechanics of how multiple predecessors are merged to create
	  a single, new revision. When this clarifies, then
	  <code>DAV:predecessor-set</code> may end up containing more
	  than zero or one predecessor URLs
	</i>
      </li>
      <li><code>DAV:checkin-date</code></li>
      <li><code>DAV:label-name-set</code></li>
      <li><code>DAV:checked-out</code></li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      The following "advanced versioning" properties will be
      implemented:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><code>DAV:version-history</code></li>
      <li>
	<code>DAV:checkout-fork</code> (protected) is set to
	<code>DAV:discouraged</code>
      </li>
      <li>
	<code>DAV:checkin-fork</code> (protected) is set to
	<code>DAV:discouraged</code>
      </li>
      <li><code>DAV:version-set</code></li>
      <li><code>DAV:initial-version</code></li>
      <li><code>DAV:unreserved</code> (protected) is set to <code>F</code></li>
    </ul>

    <h3>OPTIONS</h3>
    <p>
      The <code>OPTIONS</code> request will signal that it supports
      the following DAV features:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><code>1</code></li>
      <li><code>2</code></li>
      <li><code>core-versioning</code></li>
      <li><code>property-report</code></li>
      <li><code>activity</code></li>
      <li><code>mkactivity</code></li>
      <li><code>merge</code></li>
      <li><code>collection-versioning</code></li>
      <li><code>checkout-fork</code></li>
      <li><code>checkin-fork</code></li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      The <code>REPORT</code> method and
      <code>DAV:available-report</code> report will signal support for 
      the following reports:
      <code>DAV:available-report</code>,
      <code>DAV:repository-report</code>,
      <code>DAV:property-report</code>,
      and
      <code>DAV:compare-report</code>.
    </p>

    <h3>Notes, reminders</h3>
    <p>
      Advanced CHECKOUT to associate an activity with the working
      resource.
      <br>
      COPY into a checked-out collection must create new working
      resources (recursively).
      <br>
      Discuss timeouts and auto-purge of activities (and the related
      working resources).
      <br>
      Need a database to map working resource URLs to some semantic
      info about those working resources, and the activities they are
      a part of.
      <br>
      Need a database to map activity URLs to their relevant
      information.
