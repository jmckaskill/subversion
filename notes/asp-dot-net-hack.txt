	  Naming of working copy administrative directories
	  =================================================

Description:
============
Allow use of an alternate name for Subversion working copy
administrative directories on Windows (which were formerly always
named ".svn"), by setting the SVN_ASP_DOT_NET_HACK environment
variable


Use case:
=========

This is a hack to work around unnecessarily restrictive behavior of
ASP.NET on Windows which prevents access to directories beginning with
a dot.


Notes:
======
Once the environment variable is set, legacy working copies with
".svn" directories will stop working, and will need to be
re-checked-out.

This hack prevents sharing of working copies between Windows.

Implementation:
===============
Setting the SVN_ASP_DOT_NET_HACK environment variable only works with
the svn and svnversion binaries, and only on Windows.  It doesn't work
for libraries; users of the libraries should call the new APIs, which
are platform-indepndent

Three new platform-independent APIs were introduced into Subversion
1.3.0:

o svn_wc_is_adm_dir()
o svn_wc_get_adm_dir()
o svn_wc_set_adm_dir() - restricts the list of allowed names to .svn and _svn

Third party software that uses the Subversion libraries needs to be
updated to make the equivalent API calls.

Bindings shipped with Subversion may be updated to interpret the
SVN_ASP_DOT_NET_HACK environment variable (TBD).
