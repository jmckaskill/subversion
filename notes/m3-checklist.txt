                         The Road to Milestone 3
                         =======================

Milestone 3 is scheduled for August 15th, and is defined as
self-hosting with a command line client.  It doesn't mean that every
bit of CVS functionality is covered yet, just the ones we need to
self-host.  We will have tests for everything we do support,
including: add, checkout, commit, copy, delete, local diff, import,
propget, propset, status, update, help.

What's left to do:

* World of DAV (gstein)

     Greg is going to bring the DAV layer back up to speed.  This
     includes:

       * using the new authentication system to get user/password
       * passing this info to Apache, and then into the new write-hooks
       * making properties work -- without leaving RA-specific ones
                                   in the repository.

             (This is the semi-large project.  It may require some
              large changes to mod_dav itself, not just mod_dav_svn.
              
       * modifying python tests to run over RA_DAV (sussman will do.)


* Make a tarball dist.  (kfogel -- in progress)

  Make sure "make dist" works, establish release process, do a
  release. :-)  lucas@collab.net has volunteered to review the release
  procedure doc.


* New material on Web site (kfogel)
    - post instructions for downloading tarball, building
    - especially, put dav_setup.txt up!
    - basic subversion checkout instructions
    - update status page
    - Put the old CVS ChangeLog up


* Backup system for commits in the new svn repository.  (kfogel)

  Commit diffs should be backed up, so we don't lose data if there's
  an fs bug.  Set up a system.
