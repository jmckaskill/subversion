Goal: Allow working copy permissions to be stored in the repository and
      provide a mechanism for the client to set them in a portable way.

Idea: Have a svn:permissions property.
Problem: Define a value that can be properly interpreted on at least Unix and
         Win32-style permissions.

Unix permissions:
Summary:  u-g-o model (user, group, other).
          Each subset (u,g,o) can have read, write, and execute property.
          Traditionally represented with octets of the following form:
            read:  4
            write: 2
            exec:  1

          Each file has a specific owner and group it belongs to.
          If the uid of the user matches, the user permissions apply.
           If the gid of the user matches, the group permissions apply.
            Else, the other permissions apply.

Note: Some OSes (Solaris) have more complicated and expressive ACL
      mechanisms.
