                Subversion Tarball Release Procedure
                ====================================

1. Tweak trunk/CHANGES to contain all the latest changes.  Commit.

   Begin a new section at the top of the file with:

   Version X.YY.Z (released XX Month 200X, revision XXXX)
   http://svn.collab.net/repos/svn/tags/X.YY.Z

2. Bump the version numbers in svn_version.h and CHANGES.  Commit.

3. Create the release branch for building the release:

   a. Create the branch

      svn cp -rHEAD -m"Create release-X.YY.Z branch" \
          http://svn.collab.net/repos/svn/trunk \
          http://svn.collab.net/repos/svn/branches/release-X.YY.Z

   (Note that only the release manager commits to the branch;
    everyone else continues working on trunk, and the release
    manager ports changes across only if absolutely necessary.)

   b. Check out a working copy of the branch

      svn co http://svn.collab.net/repos/svn/branches/release-X.YY.Z

    or

      svn switch http://svn.collab.net/repos/svn/branches/release-X.YY.Z

    if you have an existing working copy

   c. Make sure your release branch wc has the following packages
      extracted into the root of the wc tree:

      apr           (see INSTALL, section I)
      apr-util      (see INSTALL, section I)
      neon          (see INSTALL, section I)
      DocBook Tools (see doc/book/README)

            *ALL* of these are needed to build Subversion.

      To install apr/apr-util, see INSTALL, section I.1.

      To install neon, see INSTALL, section I.5.

      To configure/install Apache (httpd-2.X.YY), see INSTALL,
      section I.7 and section III.  If you maintain a separate
      build/release area, and don't want to over-write an
      existing/working installation of Apache, you may want to use
      --prefix=/usr/local/apache2 to install a parallel instance of
      Apache.

      To make sure httpd.conf is properly set up for DAV access, see
      subversion/tests/clients/cmdline/README.

      Also, see sections 'Building the Latest Source under Unix' and
      'BUILDING A SUBVERSION SERVER' in the INSTALL file. for more
      detailed build information.

   d. Grab the latest docs from http://svnbook.red-bean.com/

      cd doc/book/book
      wget http://svnbook.red-bean.com/book.pdf .
      wget http://svnbook.red-bean.com/book.html .

   e. Run './autogen.sh && ./configure' so the docs can get built in
      the branch tree (in step 4, dist.sh will move the built docs
      into the release sandbox).

4. Run './dist.sh [ARGS ...]'    (see dist.sh for details about ARGS)
   Watch dist.sh's output to make sure everything goes smoothly; when
   it's done, you'll have 'subversion-X.YY.Z.tar.gz' in the cwd.

5. Test the tarball:
     a) tar zxvf subversion-X.YY.Z.tar.gz;  cd subversion-X.YY.Z
     b) ./configure

         See INSTALL, section III.B for detailed instructions
         on configuring/building Subversion.

         If you installed Apache in some place other than the default, as
         mentioned above, you will need to use the same
         --prefix=/usr/local/apache2 option as used to configure Apache.

         You may also want to use --enable-mod-activation, which will
         automatically enable the required Subversion modules in the
         Apache config file.

     c) make
     d) make check
     e) make install (this activates mod_dav)
     f) make davcheck

        For this, start up Apache after having configured according to
        the directions in subversion/tests/clients/cmdline/README.

        Make sure, that if you maintain a development installation of
        apache, that you check the config file and update it for the
        new release area where you're testing the tar-ball.
	(Unless you rename the tree which gets extracted from the
	tarball to match what's in httpd.conf, you will need to edit
	httpd.conf)

     g) make svncheck

        First, start up svnserve with these args:

         $ subversion/svnserve/svnserve -d -r \
           `pwd`/subversion/tests/clients/cmdline

        -d tells svnserve to run as a daemon
        -r tells svnserve to use the following directory as the
           logical file system root directory.

        After svnserve is running as a daemon 'make svncheck' should run

     h) Then test that you can check out the subversion repository
        with this environment:

         subversion/clients/cmdline/svn co \
                        http://svn.collab.net/repos/svn/trunk

7. Post tarball to the "File sharing" section of the tigris.org web
   site <http://subversion.tigris.org/servlets/ProjectDownloadList>:

   The ability to upload a public, automatically approved tarball
   requires the "Project Document - Approve" permission, which is a
   standard part of the "Download Manager" or "Content Developer"
   roles.  If you don't have this access, make sure you
   'Request a New Role' from the tigris web site.

   Once Download Manager status has been granted:

    a. Log into http://subversion.tigris.org
    b. Click on the 'file sharing' link (left frame at the top)
    c. Click on the 'Source tarballs' link (main frame)
    d. Click on the 'Add a file' link (top, main frame, under 'File Sharing')
    e. Fill in the following fields:

      Name: subversion-X.YY.Z.tar.gz (replace X.YY.Z with the release number)
      Status: Stable
      Description: Subversion release X.YY.Z (MD5: <md5sum of tarball>)
      Contents:  (select 'Link, 
		  enter http://svn.collab.net/repos/svn/tags/X.YY.Z)

    f. Click Submit

   To get the MD5 checksum for the tarball, make sure you have the
   md5sum command installed and from the release branch wc, run:

          md5sum subversion-X.YY.Z.tar.gz

   There will be a single line of 2 fields returned looking something like:

         $ md5sum subversion-0.25.tar.gz 
         a018220d5c790161bc712ccb7d0f1b38  subversion-0.25.tar.gz

   The 32 character alpha-numeric string on the left is the checksum.
   Use this in the Description field, and also mention it in the
   Announcement e-mail explained below.

8. Move branch into the tags directory in the repository.

     svn mv http://svn.collab.net/repos/svn/branches/release-X.YY.Z \
          http://svn.collab.net/repos/svn/tags/X.YY.Z \
          -m"Moved Release X.YY.Z branch to tags/"

   Now that the release is public, no more changes can happen on that
   branch.  If we discover problems with the release, then we make a
   new branch (with the minor version number incremented), apply
   fixes, and go through the release process again.

9. Update the website.

   a. Edit the www/project_status.html file appropriately in /trunk *NOT*
      in the release branch and commit.

      If you used 'svn switch' in 3b above, you can simply 'switch' back
      to /trunk using:

         svn switch http://svn.collab.net/repos/svn/trunk

      then edit the www/project_status.html file appropriately.

   b. Commit the modifications of www/project_status.html 

   c. Remind someone with an @collab.net address to update the live
      web site (we used to have a servlet for this, but at the moment
      we don't).

10. Post news item <http://subversion.tigris.org/servlets/ProjectNewsAdd>,
    and send an announcement to dev@, users@, and announce@ lists.

11. Someone with administrative access upgrade svn.collab.net to head,
    then repeat step 5e.  This is *NOT* usually the release manager.
