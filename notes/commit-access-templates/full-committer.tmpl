Subject: Full commit access to Subversion

Hi New Full Committer,

The other committers and I would like to offer you full commit access
to Subversion.  

If you already have partial commit access, you can accept this offer
by simply replying to this mail.  We'll update the COMMITTERS file (or
you can do it yourself, that's fine too).

If you do not already have partial commit access, you can accept this
offer by replying to this mail and following the instructions at
<http://www.apache.org/dev/new-committers-guide.html#cla>.  A temporary
password will be chosen for you and revealed via email.  Once you are
notified that your account has been created, and that it has been
granted access to the /subversion/** tree (this is a separate step from
creating the account), you are encouraged to modify the COMMITTERS file
appropriately, which also serves as a test of your new username and
password.

Please remember to subscribe to the private (PMC) mailing list by
emailing <private-subscribe@subversion.apache.org>.

Remember that you can still post patches for review before committing,
when you want to.  Commit access just means that you can rely on your
own judgment to decide when something is ready for commit.  Also, if
you haven't done so already, please read

   http://subversion.tigris.org/hacking.html

Thanks for all your work so far!

- Some Full Committer
