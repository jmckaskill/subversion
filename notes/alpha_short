               Master Todo List to Get to M3 (self-hosting)
               ============================================

This is a compressed list of tasks from 'alpha-checklist', with
comments and minor annotations about who is actually doing them.  For
more verbose descriptions of these issues, look in alpha-checklist,
though.

* Greg Stein is putting the finishing touches on M2.  He has
  checkouts, commits, and updates working over DAV. Only "import" is
  left.

* Client test suite improvements (Ben, Sam TH, and others are doing,
  have got the new Python test suite up, just a matter of writing lots
  of tests).

* new 'libsvn_repos':  utils built on *top* of libsvn_fs

   * cross-process read/write lock function for DB_RUN_RECOVERY. (Greg)
   * hook system -- to fire off shell scripts.  (Karl defines, Greg imps)

* Many filesystem improvements

   * strings table                    /* part of implementing above */

* cvs2svn (Thom and Greg)

* general pool usage code-review (Greg and Fitz)

* change #6:  invert text-delta interface (Greg)

* simple Apache-only authentication & authorization (Greg)


POST-M3 ITEMS
=============

* Many filesystem improvements

   * deltified storage                /* necessary */
   * real file streaming              /* may be done with above */
   * dir_delta use 'copyfrom' args    /* Mike, is this done? */
   * keep node-rev-id strings short   /* Karl will do, solution is known */
   * copy properties                  /* yeaaaah */

* 'svn cp' and friends: cp, mv, branch, tag. (Mike Pilato to start).

* misc subcommands:  svn cleanup, log, export, diff, rdiff, blame, merge,
                     revert, rollback, unadd, undel.  (Chicago office)

* autodetection of text/binary file types, and defaults for keyword
  substitution and newline translation. (Karl)

* internalized diff/patch library:  (Ben will investigate)

* user documentation (Karl will research/look for volunteers)

* UTF-8 preparations (Jim)

* wc improvement: deal with removing files when dir is *not*
  up-to-date.  (Karl.  Part of a general fix to entries handling, that
  doesn't, afaik, require any new research.)
