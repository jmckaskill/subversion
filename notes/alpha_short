               Master Todo List to Get to M3 (self-hosting)
               ============================================

This is a compressed list of tasks from 'alpha-checklist', with
comments and minor annotations about who is actually doing them.  For
more verbose descriptions of these issues, look in alpha-checklist,
though.

* Greg Stein is maybe still putting the finishing touches on M2.  He
  has commits/imports/updates working over DAV, except for bugfixes,
  is that right Greg?

* Client test suite improvements (Ben, Sam TH, and others are doing,
  have got the new Python test suite up, just a matter of writing lots
  of tests).

* 'svn cp' and friends: cp, mv, branch, tag. (Mike Pilato to start).

* new 'libsvn_repos':  utils built on *top* of libsvn_fs

   * cross-process read/write lock function for DB_RUN_RECOVERY. (Greg)
   * hook system -- to fire off shell scripts.  (who?)
   * new location of fs commit-editor (Ben)
   * new location of delta_dirs and wrapper (Mike)
   * new location of shared 'reporter' code for both RA layers (Ben)

* Many filesystem improvements

   * deltified storage                /* necessary */
   * strings table                    /* part of implementing above */
   * real file streaming              /* may be done with above */
   * dir_delta use 'copyfrom' args    /* Mike, is this done? */
   * keep node-rev-id strings short   /* Karl will do, solution is known */
   * copy properties                  /* yeaaaah */

* misc subcommands:  svn cleanup, log, export, diff, rdiff, blame, merge,
                     revert, rollback, unadd, undel.  (Chicago office)

* autodetection of text/binary file types, and defaults for keyword
  substitution and newline translation. (Karl)

* change #6:  invert text-delta interface (Greg)

* simple Apache-only authentication & authorization (Greg)

* internalized diff/patch library:  (Ben will investigate)

* user documentation (Karl will research/look for volunteers)

* cvs2svn (Thom and Greg)

* UTF-8 preparations (Jim)

* general pool usage code-review (Greg and Fitz)

* wc improvement: deal with removing files when dir is *not*
  up-to-date.  (Karl.  Part of a general fix to entries handling, that
  doesn't, afaik, require any new research.)

* change ra_local commit-style (Ben & Greg discuss)



POST-1.0
========

* a "real" internal ACL system

* svn obliterate

* genetic merging

* GUI clients

* i18n
  
* read-only repos mirrors
