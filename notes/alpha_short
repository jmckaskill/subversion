more verbose descriptions of these issues, look in alpha-checklist,
though.

POST-M3 ITEMS
=============

* Many filesystem improvements

   * real file streaming              /* may be done with above */
   * dir_delta use 'copyfrom' args    /* Mike, is this done? */
   * keep node-rev-id strings short   /* Karl will do, solution is known */
   * copy properties                  /* yeaaaah */

* 'svn cp' and friends: cp, mv, branch, tag. (Mike Pilato to start).

* misc subcommands:  svn cleanup, log, export, diff, rdiff, blame, merge,
                     revert, rollback, unadd, undel.  (Chicago office)

* autodetection of text/binary file types, and defaults for keyword
  substitution and newline translation. (Karl)

* internalized diff/patch library:  (Ben will investigate)

* user documentation (Karl will research/look for volunteers)

* UTF-8 preparations (Jim)

* wc improvement: deal with removing files when dir is *not*
  up-to-date.  (Karl.  Part of a general fix to entries handling, that
  doesn't, afaik, require any new research.)
