Here are some random notes on tools we'd like to use:

* glib : general C utility library, extremely portable.  

	  Gives us tons of string routines, linked lists, trees,
	  hashtables, standardized types, debugging & logging macros,
	  time & date routines, safer memory routines.

	  License:  LGPL

* gdbm : GNU dbm, for implementing hashes/database in binary files

	  License: GPL

* gettext : GNU system for i18n of software, both at compile and run-time

	  License: GPL

* autoconf : GNU system for portable compilation

	  License: GPL
