This file exists to attempt to track the resources and ideas that are
present in the Subversion community on the topic of GUIs for Subversion.

be added (or removed) from this list, and you have commit access to the
Subversion project, feel free to make the edit.  If you don't have commit
access, just pop a mail off to dev@subversion.tigris.org and request
the change be made.
