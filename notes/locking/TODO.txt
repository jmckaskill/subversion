TODO for locking
================


MUST HAVE
---------

* notification-system rewrite;  patch is in progress.  (lundblad)

     - make 'svn up' use new system to tell user that a defunct token
       has been deleted.

     - make svn_client_(un)lock() use the new notify callback also.

* fix 'svnadmin lslocks', 'svnlook lock', and 'svn info wcpath-or-URL'
  to handle the lock comment output, which can be multiple lines, in
  the same (at least similar) way that 'svn log' treats log messages,
  so they can be machine parseable. (fitz)

* lock-null support:

    - finish issue 2161: PROPFIND depth 1 should show locked,
      nonexistent paths.  This means svn_fs_get_locks() should take a
      depth (=1) argument; change BDB locking tables implementation to
      make this feasible. (cmpilato)

    - 'svn lock/unlock/info lock-null-URL' should work over all 3 RA
      layers, but then disable this feature for 1.2 (sussman)

    - explicitly prevent 'svn lock schedule-add-wcpath' (sussman)

* scan the whole patch for TODO items introduced on the branch. (all, please)


NICE TO HAVE
------------

* improve cmdline help messages

* possibly teach mailer.py to send lock/unlock mails (fitz)

* remove ra_svn shim for multiple locks/unlocks (fitz)

* client test cases (fitz) [broad cases done]

* get httpd 2.0.54 released, so that svn 1.2 can compile on win32

* get neon 0.25 released, so the control-c bug can go away
  (chat with jorton about neon 0.25/svn 1.2 coordination?)

* make --keep-locks into a runtime 'config' option

-----------------------------------------------

* Questions:

   * Decide what should happen when unlocking in commit if an error happens.

   * how do locks relate to dump/load?  file as an enhancement? 


* Stuff to document in book:
     
       - 4 new hooks
       - 'lock' and 'unlock' commands, svn:needs-lock property.
       - svnadmin lslocks, rmlocks, lock
       - svnlook lock
       - 'svn info URL'
       - 'svn st -u' additions
       - new 'svn up' and 'svn commit' behaviors w.r.t. locktokens
       - two new bdb tables in BDB section.
       - update the description of autoversioning in appendix C!

         ### remember to update authz policy doc. 

* Autoversioning TODO:

 * propfind depth 1 on a collection should show lock-null resources.
   currently not happening.  can this be done *compatibly* with svn
   clients?

 * finish autoversioning:  see bug in issue 2161.
        --> autoversioning on win32 webfolders and MSWord ?
        --> investigate XP workaround for webfolders:

            IE->File->Open->URL, check 'open as webfolder'?
