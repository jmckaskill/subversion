TODO for locking
================


MUST HAVE
---------

* svn status -u shows lock info from repos.  (lundblad)

* 'svn up' needs to notify when it deletes a defunct token
       --> depends on patch-in-progress:
           rev svn_wc_notify_func_t (on trunk) (lundblad/sussman)

* fix svn_fs_access_t handling in svnserve (sussman)

* ?? make post-lock and post-unlock take list of paths.
   
       --> then possibly teach mailer.py to send lock/unlock mails.

* autoversioning:

    - finish issue 2161:  PROPFIND depth 1 should show locked,
      nonexistent paths.  (cmpilato)

    - research interoperability with popular dav clients (collabnet folks)

* fix svn_xml_is_xml_safe.  currently, it allows invalid UTF8!  (lundblad?)

* remove auto-force behaviour for svn unlock URL.

* scan the whole patch for TODO items introduced on the branch. (all, please)


NICE TO HAVE
------------

* improve cmdline help messages

* remove ra_svn shim for multiple locks/unlocks (fitz)

* client test cases (fitz) [broad cases done]

* get httpd 2.0.54 released, so that svn 1.2 can compile on win32

* get neon 0.25 released, so the control-c bug can go away
  (chat with jorton about neon 0.25/svn 1.2 coordination?)

* make --keep-locks into a runtime 'config' option

* Fixups for r13392.  Posting by lundblad.

-----------------------------------------------

* Questions:

   * Decide what should happen when unlocking in commit if an error happens.

   * how do locks relate to dump/load?  file as an enhancement? 


* Stuff to document in book:
     
       - 4 new hooks
       - 'lock' and 'unlock' commands, svn:needs-lock property.
       - svnadmin lslocks, rmlocks, lock
       - svnlook lock
       - 'svn info URL'
       - 'svn st -u' additions
       - new 'svn up' and 'svn commit' behaviors w.r.t. locktokens
       - two new bdb tables in BDB section.
       - update the description of autoversioning in appendix C!

         ### remember to update authz policy doc. 

* Autoversioning TODO:

 * propfind depth 1 on a collection should show lock-null resources.
   currently not happening.  can this be done *compatibly* with svn
   clients?

 * finish autoversioning:  see bug in issue 2161.
        --> autoversioning on win32 webfolders and MSWord ?
        --> investigate XP workaround for webfolders:

            IE->File->Open->URL, check 'open as webfolder'?
