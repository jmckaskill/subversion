TODO for locking
================


MUST HAVE
---------

* extended structure issues:

   - create svn_wc_status2_t() and svn_wc_create_status() (sussman)

* Slog through Julian Foad's 1.2 API Review email.

* Determine what to do about the fact that if someone schedules a file
  for deletion, and then commits it with the --no-unlock switch, the
  repository will retain a lock on a (now) nonexistent path.  One
  argument is that this is OK as long as we can delete the lock via a
  URL.  The other argument is that, on a delete, the lock should be
  unconditionally deleted.

  Currently, the commit fails over ra_dav (fix in-progress by sussman
  et al.)

* subversion/libsvn_wc/status.c:982
    /* ### lundblad TODO: Make sure lock info is added. */ (lundblad)

NICE TO HAVE
------------

* improve cmdline help messages

* put quotes around user names as well as around lock names when we error.

* support cancelation during lock/unlock.

* possibly teach mailer.py to send lock/unlock mails (fitz)

* remove ra_svn shim for multiple locks/unlocks (fitz)

* client test cases (fitz) [broad cases done]

* get httpd 2.0.54 released, so that svn 1.2 can compile on win32

* get neon 0.25 released, so the control-c bug can go away
  (chat with jorton about neon 0.25/svn 1.2 coordination?)

* subversion/clients/cmdline/lock-cmd.c:66
    /* ### Should we do this in a loop like for the commit message? */ (lundblad)

-----------------------------------------------

* Questions:

   * Decide what should happen when unlocking in commit if an error happens.

   * Should propedit and propset reject to set a property an a file with
     svn:needs-lock set?

   * how do locks relate to dump/load?  file as an enhancement? 


* Stuff to document in book:
     
       - 4 new hooks
       - 'lock' and 'unlock' commands, svn:needs-lock property.
       - svnadmin lslocks, rmlocks, lock
       - svnlook lock
       - 'svn info URL'
       - 'svn st -u' additions
       - new 'svn up' and 'svn commit' behaviors w.r.t. locktokens
       - two new bdb tables in BDB section.
       - update the description of autoversioning in appendix C!

         ### remember to update authz policy doc. 

* Autoversioning TODO:

 * propfind depth 1 on a collection should show lock-null resources.
   currently not happening.  can this be done *compatibly* with svn
   clients?

 * finish autoversioning:  see bug in issue 2161.
        --> autoversioning on win32 webfolders and MSWord ?
        --> investigate XP workaround for webfolders:

            IE->File->Open->URL, check 'open as webfolder'?
