TODO for locking
================


MUST HAVE
---------

* svn update removes defunct locks
  - Send lock tokens over ra_dav (sussman)

* svn status -u shows lock info from repos.  (lundblad)

* research future ra_dav shim removal plan:  will it work? (sussman)

* chat with jorton about neon 0.25/svn1.2 coordination.

* fix svn_fs_access_t handling in svnserve (lundblad?)
   
* autoversioning:

    - fix issue 2161 (sussman)
    - research interoperability with popular dav clients (fitz)

* test 4 new hook scripts.  do they actually work?


NICE TO HAVE
------------

* svn lock and unlock should continue with next target on certain errors

* improve cmdline help messages

* 'svn lock URL' should work, no working copy required.  easy to
   do, just throw away the svn_lock_t that comes back.

* 'svn unlock URL --force' should work with no working copy present.

* rev svn_wc_notify_func_t (on trunk) (lundblad)

* remove ra_svn shim for multiple locks/unlocks (fitz)

* client test cases (fitz) [broad cases done]

* get httpd 2.0.54 released, so that svn 1.2 can compile on win32

* get neon 0.25 released, so the control-c bug can go away

* make --keep-locks into a runtime 'config' option


-----------------------------------------------

* Questions:

   * Decide what should happen when unlocking in commit if an error happens.

   * how do locks relate to dump/load?  file as an enhancement? 


* Stuff to document in book:
     
       - 4 new hooks
       - 'lock' and 'unlock' commands, svn:needs-lock property.
       - svnadmin lslocks, rmlocks, lock
       - svnlook lock
       - 'svn info URL'
       - 'svn st -u' additions
       - new 'svn up' and 'svn commit' behaviors w.r.t. locktokens
       - two new bdb tables in BDB section.
       - update the description of autoversioning in appendix C!

         ### remember to update authz policy doc. 

* Autoversioning TODO:

 * propfind depth 1 on a collection should show lock-null resources.
   currently not happening.  can this be done *compatibly* with svn
   clients?

 * finish autoversioning:  see bug in issue 2161.
        --> autoversioning on win32 webfolders and MSWord ?
        --> investigate XP workaround for webfolders:

            IE->File->Open->URL, check 'open as webfolder'?
