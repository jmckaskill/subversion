TODO for locking
===============

This is a summary of the current state of the locking implementation.

* svn info URL (sussman)
* svn update removes defunct locks
  - Send lock tokens over ra_dav (sussman?)
  - WC stuff (lundblad)
  - Client changes
* Rev svn_wc_notify_func_t (on trunk) (lundblad)
* svn status -u shows lock info from repos.
* client test cases (fitz) [broad cases done]
* Fix svn_fs_access_t handling in svnserve
* Fix svn_ra_unlock force==true for ra_dav.
* Improve cmdline help messages
* svn lock and unlock should continue with next target on certain errors
* Decide what should happen when unlocking in commit operation if an error
  happens.


LIST DISCUSSIONS TO HAVE:

  ### should we bump the format file, so a libsvn_fs 1.0 or 1.1
      library isn't allowed to circumvent locks?

  ### how do locks relate to 

              - dumping/loading?
              - backups?
              - mirroring scripts?



DAV bugs:

 -- Make ra_dav error on non-xml-safe lock comments,
    and make mod_dav_svn fuzzily-escape lock-comments coming out of repos.

 -- BUG:  header length limits in MERGE request.
          SOLUTION:
              - pass locktoken hash in MERGE request body as new XML element.
              - rev the provider API:  ap_lookup_provider()
                 - fix get_locktoken_list()
                 -  pass <D:merge> element to provider merge()                 
                 -  new lock vtable with *one* function to add lock
              - svn 1.2 will require httpd-2.0.53

 -- BUG: 'svn commit' does a no-op commit if locks exist in wc, but
          files have no edits.  creates a commit with no changed paths!




Stuff to document in book:
     
       - 4 new hooks
       - 'lock' and 'unlock' commands, svn:needs-lock property.
       - svnadmin lslocks, rmlocks, lock
       - svnlook lock
       - two new bdb tables in BDB section.
       - update the description of autoversioning in appendix C!

         ### remember to update authz policy doc. 



Autoversioning Compatibility Issues:

 * propfind depth 1 on a collection should show lock-null resources.
   currently not happening.  can this be done *compatibly* with svn
   clients?

 * finish autoversioning:  see bug in issue 2161.
        --> autoversioning on win32 webfolders and MSWord ?
        --> investigate XP workaround for webfolders:

            IE->File->Open->URL, check 'open as webfolder'?
