TODO for locking
================


NICE TO HAVE
------------

* put quotes around user names as well as around lock names when we error.

* support cancellation during lock/unlock.

-----------------------------------------------

* Questions:

   * Should propedit and propset reject to set a property an a file with
     svn:needs-lock set?

   * how do locks relate to dump/load?  file as an enhancement? 


* Stuff to document in book:
     
       - 4 new hooks
       - 'lock' and 'unlock' commands, svn:needs-lock property.
       - svnadmin lslocks, rmlocks, lock
       - svnlook lock
       - 'svn info URL'
       - 'svn st -u' additions
       - new 'svn up' and 'svn commit' behaviors w.r.t. locktokens
       - two new bdb tables in BDB section.
       - update the description of autoversioning in appendix C!
