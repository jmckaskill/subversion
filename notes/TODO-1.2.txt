TO-DO list for svn 1.2
=======================


CODING TASKS:

   - Slog through Julian Foad's 1.2 API Review email.

   - create svn_wc_status2_t() and svn_wc_create_status() (sussman)

   - finish Dan Berlin's streamy-blame stuff;  make it work with libsvn_diff.

   - 'svn st -u' should show remote locks on files not yet in the
     working copy.  (lundblad)

   - subversion/libsvn_wc/status.c:982
      /* ### lundblad TODO: Make sure lock info is added. */ (lundblad)

   - build system:

        - any changes maxb wants to make?

        - verify mod_dav_svn build on win32 with httpd-trunk patch.

   - bindings:  

       (note that bindings changes don't restart the soak period,
        so the 1.2 branch-freeze don't need to block on these things)

        - any swig cleanup folks want to do?

        - perl bindings will be caught up shortly (clkao)

        - javahl bindings need to catch up a tiny bit


BUGS:

   -  Fix segfault in mod_dav_svn when attempting to lock multiple files
      at once (fitz).

   - another issuetracker sweep of 1.2 things?


QUESTIONS:

   - Determine what to do about the fact that if someone schedules a
     file for deletion, and then commits it with the --no-unlock
     switch, the repository will retain a lock on a (now) nonexistent
     path.  One argument is that this is OK as long as we can delete
     the lock via a URL.  The other argument is that, on a delete, the
     lock should be unconditionally deleted.


DOC:

   - write 1.2 CHANGES entry  (sussman, in progress)

   - final tweaks to 1.2 releasenotes (sussman)

   - INSTALL:  explain how to build mod_dav_svn on win32 w/patch


TESTS:

   - we need MORE lock_tests.py test. more, more, more.

   - continue testing various DAV clients against autoversioning.

   - figure out what to do about utf_tests.py #1 once and for all, so
     it passes on *all* systems.


OTHER:

   - push for a 2.0.54 release within the month, so that we don't have
     to require win32 build patch for mod_dav?

   - push for neon 0.25 release?
