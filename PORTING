        talking seriously about fixing up the NetBSD patch to support
        the gnu patch features needed by subversion.)

     Tester:     Sam.Cooper@scisys.co.uk
     Notes:
     -- gcc 2.95.2
     -- failed to check out a working copy, but think this may be due
        to running "svn checkout URL -d ../path".  Perhaps the ".." in
        the target stimulated a universal Subversion bug, i.e., has
        nothing to do with it being Solaris 2.6.  Have asked Sam
        Cooper to try it without ".." and let us know what happens.
        If it is what we think it is, then will file as a separate
        Subversion issue.
