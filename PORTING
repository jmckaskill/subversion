#    Notes: 
#    -- Still cannot build with --wapcapplet-enabled
#    -- The dependency on the wanglethorpe is really making things
#       unreasonably hard here. I'm going to try to link against the
#       frobnicator to see if I can't get the filesystem to
#       build. -J. Random

# To find out your canonical host triplet, run ac-helpers/config.guess
