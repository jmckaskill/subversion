# The purpose of this document is to provide information for people who:
# 
#   - want to know if Subversion works on a particular platform
#   - are interested in porting Subversion to a particular platform

# Entries should look something like this:

#       -- Still cannot build with --wapcapplet-enabled
#       -- The dependency on the wanglethorpe is really making things
#          unreasonably hard here. I'm going to try to link against the
#          frobnicator to see if I can't get the filesystem to
#          build. -J. Random

# The `HTTP' and `HTTP + Filesystem' lines describe the results of
# building and testing the Subversion client with the specified access
# methods to a Subversion repository.  The first line, `HTTP', refers
# to a Subversion client that *can only* access a Subversion
# repository via HTTP or possibly HTTPS; it does not have direct
# access to a Subversion repository via the local filesystem, (even if
# there may be a Subversion repository on a local filesystem, this
# Subversion client must still talk to a Subversion server to access
# the repository).  This means that the client was not compiled
# against the Berkeley Database libraries.  The `HTTP + Filesystem'
# line describes the results of a Subversion client that was compiled
# and tested that included the Berkeley Database library.  This
# Subversion client can directly access Subversion repositories stored
# in local filesystems without needing the Subversion server.
#
# Because the Subversion `HTTP + Filesystem' client is a super set of
# the `HTTP' client and the test suite for the `HTTP + Filesystem'
# client includes the tests for the `HTTP' client, then if the `HTTP +
# Filesystem' client passes all tests, then so must the `HTTP' client.
#
# To discover your canonical host triplet, run ac-helpers/config.guess
# after autogen.sh.  If you can't discover a canonical host triplet,
# or for some reason it's not applicable, you can just say something
# like "RedHat Linux 7.2 (intel) 2.4.9-13 kernel".

        system-neutral dependencies are listed in the INSTALL file.

     Notes:
     -- gcc 2.95.2
     -- failed to check out a working copy, but think this may be due
        to running "svn checkout URL ../path".  Perhaps the ".." in
        the target stimulated a universal Subversion bug, i.e., has
        nothing to do with it being Solaris 2.6.  Have asked Sam
        Cooper to try it without ".." and let us know what happens.
        If it is what we think it is, then will file as a separate
        Subversion issue.
