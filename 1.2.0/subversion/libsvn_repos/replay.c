/*** Backstory ***/

/* The year was 2003.  Subversion usage was rampant in the world, and
   there was a rapidly growing issues database to prove it.  To make
   matters worse, svn_repos_dir_delta() had simply outgrown itself.
   No longer content to simply describe the differences between two
   trees, the function had been slowly bearing the added
   responsibility of representing the actions that had been taken to
   cause those differences -- a burden it was never meant to bear.
   Now grown into a twisted mess of razor-sharp metal and glass, and
   trembling with a sort of momentarily stayed spring force,
   svn_repos_dir_delta was a timebomb poised for total annihilation of
   the American Midwest.
   
   Subversion needed a change.

   Changes, in fact.  And not just in the literary segue sense.  What
   Subversion desperately needed was a new mechanism solely
   responsible for replaying repository actions back to some
   interested party -- to translate and retransmit the contents of the
   Berkeley 'changes' database file. */

/*** Overview ***/

/* The filesystem keeps a record of high-level actions that affect the
   files and directories in itself.  The 'changes' table records
   additions, deletions, textual and property modifications, and so
   on.  The goal of the functions in this file is to examine those
   change records, and use them to drive an editor interface in such a
   way as to effectively replay those actions.

   This is critically different than what svn_repos_dir_delta() was
   designed to do.  That function describes, in the simplest way it
   can, how to transform one tree into another.  It doesn't care
   whether or not this was the same way a user might have done this
   transformation.  More to the point, it doesn't care if this is how
   those differences *did* come into being.  And it is for this reason
   that it cannot be relied upon for tasks such as the repository
   dumpfile-generation code, which is supposed to represent not
   changes, but actions that cause changes.

   So, what's the plan here?

   First, we fetch the changes for a particular revision or
   transaction.  We get these as an array, sorted chronologically.
   From this array we will build a hash, keyed on the path associated
   with each change item, and whose values are arrays of changes made
   to that path, again preserving the chronological ordering.

   Once our hash it built, we then sort all the keys of the hash (the
   paths) using a depth-first directory sort routine.

   Finally, we drive an editor, moving down our list of sorted paths,
   and manufacturing any intermediate editor calls (directory openings
   and closures) needed to navigate between each successive path.  For
   each path, we replay the sorted actions that occurred at that path.

   We we've finished the editor drive, we should have fully replayed
   the filesystem events that occurred in that revision or transactions
   (though not necessarily in the same order in which they
   occurred). */
