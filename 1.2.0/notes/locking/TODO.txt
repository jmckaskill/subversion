TODO for locking
================


(see notes/TODO-1.2.txt for the master list)



NICE TO HAVE
------------

* improve cmdline help messages

* put quotes around user names as well as around lock names when we error.

* support cancellation during lock/unlock.

* possibly teach mailer.py to send lock/unlock mails (fitz)

* remove ra_svn shim for multiple locks/unlocks (fitz)

* subversion/clients/cmdline/lock-cmd.c:66
    /* ### Should we do this in a loop like for the commit message? */ (lundblad)

-----------------------------------------------

* Questions:

   * Should propedit and propset reject to set a property an a file with
     svn:needs-lock set?

   * how do locks relate to dump/load?  file as an enhancement? 


* Stuff to document in book:
     
       - 4 new hooks
       - 'lock' and 'unlock' commands, svn:needs-lock property.
       - svnadmin lslocks, rmlocks, lock
       - svnlook lock
       - 'svn info URL'
       - 'svn st -u' additions
       - new 'svn up' and 'svn commit' behaviors w.r.t. locktokens
       - two new bdb tables in BDB section.
       - update the description of autoversioning in appendix C!
