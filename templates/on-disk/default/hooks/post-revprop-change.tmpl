# POST-REVPROP-CHANGE HOOK
#
# The post-revprop-change hook is invoked after a revision property
# has been changed. Subversion runs this hook by invoking a program
# (script, executable, binary, etc.) named `post-revprop-change'
# (for which this file is a template), with the following ordered
# arguments:
#
#   [1] REPOS-PATH   (the path to this repository)
#   [2] REV          (the revision that was tweaked)
#   [3] USER         (the username of the person tweaking the property)
#   [4] PROPNAME     (the property that was changed)
#
# Because the propchange has already completed and cannot be undone,
# the exit code of the hook program is ignored.  The hook program
# can use the `svnlook' utility to help it examine the
# new property value.
#
# On a Unix system, the normal procedure is to have `post-revprop-change'
# invoke other programs to do the real work, though it may do the
# work itself too.
#
# Note that `post-revprop-change' must be executable by the user(s) who will
# invoke it (typically the user httpd runs as), and that user must
# have filesystem-level permission to access the repository.
#
# On a Windows system, you should name the hook program
# `post-revprop-change.bat' or `post-revprop-change.exe',
# but the basic idea is the same.
# 
# Here is an example hook script, for a Unix /bin/sh interpreter:

REPOS="$1"
REV="$2"
USER="$3"
PROPNAME="$4"

propchange-email.pl "$REPOS" "$REV" "$USER" "$PROPNAME" watchers@example.org
