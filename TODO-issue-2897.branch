* Implement the non-reflective merge editor to grok the local mods from
  a commit which has 'merge + conflict resolution + some other changes'.

* Fix the finding mergeinfo from a parent logic for 
'get-commit-and-merge-ranges' API, which is terribly broken as of now.

* Make merge_source and merge_target given to 'get-commit-and-merge-ranges'
  peg revision aware.
