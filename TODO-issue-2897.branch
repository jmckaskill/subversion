* Current code to get commit_revs in 
  subversion/libsvn_fs_util/mergeinfo-sqlite-index.c could fail for the 
  following case,
  - merge rX from /trunk to /fb and commit it in rY.
  - merge rX+1 from /trunk to /fb and commit it in rY+1.
  - Now /fb will have a mergeinfo of 
   """
    /trunk:rX-X+1
   """
  - When we merge /fb to /trunk working copy we will have the merge_rangelist
    to get the commit revs to be 'rX-X+1', This can not get any details as
    the commits revs are recorded in two different commit revs and our
    SELECT query need to be tweaked.

* Write a testcase for the above sceneario.

* Author a testcase to show the problem with 'filtering a reflective merge rev'
  altogether.

* Implement the non-reflective merge editor to grok the local mods from
  a commit which has 'merge + conflict resolution + some other changes'.

* Expose svn_rangelist_parse and consume it from svnserve and mod_dav_svn.
