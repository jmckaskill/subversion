Participating in the community
==============================

Although Subversion is originally sponsored and hosted by CollabNet
(http://www.collab.net), it's a true open-source project under a
BSD-style license.  A number of developers work for CollabNet, some
work for other large companies (such as RedHat), and many others are
simply excellent volunteers who are interested in building a better
version control system.

The community exists mainly through mailing lists and a Subversion
repository.  To participate:

Go to http://subversion.tigris.org/ and

   *  Join the "dev", "svn", and "announce" mailing lists.
      The dev list, dev@subversion.tigris.org, is where almost all
      discussion takes place.  All questions should go there, though
      you might want to check the list archives first.  The "svn"
      list receives automated commit emails.

   *  Print out and digest the Subversion design specification.
      This document can be found in the "Documents & files" area of the
      website in the Documentation/Design folder.  A PDF and an HTML
      version are available on the web.  The design spec will give you
      a theoretical overview of Subversion's design.

There are many ways to join the project, either by writing code, or by
testing and/or helping to manage the bug database.  If you'd like to
contribute, then look at:

   *  The bugs/issues database
      http://subversion.tigris.org/project_issues.html

   *  The bite-sized tasks page
      http://subversion.tigris.org/project_tasks.html

To submit code, simply send your patches to dev@subversion.tigris.org.
No, wait, first read the rest of this file, _then_ start sending
patches to dev@subversion.tigris.org. :-)

To help manage the issues database, read over the issue summaries,
looking and testing for issues that are either invalid, or are
duplicates of other issues.  Both kinds are very common, the first
because bugs often get unknowingly fixed as side effects of other
changes in the code, and the second because people sometimes file an
issue without noticing that it has already been reported.  If you are
not sure about an issue, post a question to dev@subversion.tigris.org.
("Subversion: We're here to help you help us!")

Another way to help is to set up automated builds and test suite runs
of Subversion on some platform, and have the output sent to the
svn-breakage@subversion.tigris.org mailing list.  See more details at
http://subversion.tigris.org/servlets/ProjectMailingListList, in the
description for the svn-breakage list.



Theory and documentation
========================

   1. DESIGN
      A design spec was written in June 2000, and is a bit out of
      date.  But it still gives a good theoretical introduction to the
      inner workings of the repository, and to Subversion's various
      layers.  The Texinfo source is in 'doc/programmer/design/', or
      look at one of the versions posted on the Subversion website.


   2. WEBDAV
      Greg Stein has written an introduction to Subversion's network
      protocol, which is an extended dialect of HTTP.  The document is
      'www/webdav-usage.html', and is also posted on the website in
      the "File sharing" section.


   3. USER MANUAL
      Subversion: The Definitive Guide is an upcoming title to be
      published by O'Reilly that shows in detail how to effectively
      use Subversion.  This book is still being written, so the
      contents are still in flux.  You may find it in the
      Documentation/Book folder on the "File sharing" section of the
      Subversion website.  The XML source is in 'doc/book/book'.


   4. SYSTEM NOTES
      A lot of the design ideas for particular aspects of the system
      have been documented in individual files in the 'notes'
      directory.



What to read
============

Before you can contribute code, you'll need to familiarize yourself
with the existing code base and interfaces.

Check out a copy of Subversion (anonymously, if you don't yet have an
account with commit-access) -- so you can look at the code base.

Within 'subversion/include/' are a bunch of header files with huge
doc comments.  If you read through these, you'll have a pretty good
understanding of the implementation details.  Here's a suggested
perusal order:

   *  the basic building blocks:  svn_string.h, svn_error.h, svn_types.h

   *  useful utilities:  svn_io.h, svn_path.h, svn_hash.h, svn_xml.h

   *  the critical interface:  svn_delta.h

   *  client-side interfaces:  svn_ra.h, svn_wc.h, svn_client.h

   *  the repository and versioned filesystem:  svn_repos.h, svn_fs.h


Subversion tries to stay portable by using only ANSI/ISO C and by
using the Apache Portable Runtime (APR) library.  APR is the
portability layer used by the Apache httpd server, and more
information can be found at http://apr.apache.org.

Because Subversion depends so heavily on APR, it may be hard to
understand Subversion without first glancing over certain header files
in APR (look in 'apr/include/'):

   *  memory pools:  apr_pools.h

   *  filesystem access:  apr_file_io.h

   *  hashes and arrays:  apr_hash.h, apr_tables.h


Subversion also tries to deliver reliable and secure software. This can
only be achieved by educating the developers on secure programming in
the C programming language. Please see 'notes/assurance.txt' for the
full rationale behind this.  Specifically, you should make it a point to
carefully read David Wheeler's Secure Programming (as mentioned in
'notes/assurance.txt'). If at any point you have questions about the
security implications of a change, you are urged to ask for review on
the developer mailing list.

Coding style
============

To understand how things work, read doc/svn-design.{texi,info,ps,pdf},
and read the header files, which tend to have thoroughly-commented
data structures.

We're using ANSI C, and following the GNU coding standards.  Emacs
users can just load svn-dev.el to get the right indentation behavior
(most source files here will load it automatically, if
`enable-local-eval' is set appropriately).

Read http://www.gnu.org/prep/standards.html for a full description of
the GNU coding standards; but here is a short example demonstrating
the most important formatting guidelines:

   char *                                     /* func type on own line */
   argblarg (char *arg1, int arg2)            /* func name on own line */
   {                                          /* first brace on own line */
     if ((some_very_long_condition && arg2)   /* indent 2 cols */
         || remaining_condition)              /* new line before operator */
       {                                      /* brace on own line, indent 2 */
         arg1 = some_func (arg1, arg2);       /* space before opening paren */
       }                                      /* close brace on own line */
     else
       {
         do                                   /* format do-while like this */
           {
             arg1 = another_func (arg1);
           }
           while (*arg1);
       }
   }

In general, be generous with parentheses even when you're sure about
the operator precedence, and be willing to add spaces and newlines to
avoid "code crunch".  Don't worry too much about vertical density;
it's more important to make code readable than to fit that extra line
on the screen.

The controversial GNU convention of putting a space between a function
name and its opening parenthesis is optional in Subversion.  If you're
editing an area of code that already seems to have a consistent
preference about this, then just stick with that; otherwise, pick
whichever way you like.



Secure coding guidelines
========================

Just like almost any other programming language, C has undesirable
features which enables an attacker to make your program fail in
predictable ways, often to the attacker's benefit. The goal of these
guidelines is to make you aware of the pitfalls of C as they apply to
the Subversion project.  You are encouraged to keep these pitfalls in
mind when reviewing code of your peers, as even the most skilled and
paranoid programmers make occasional mistakes.

Input validation is the act of defining legal input and rejecting
everything else. The code must perform input validation on all untrusted
input. 


Security boundaries

A security boundary in the Subversion server code must be identified as
such as this enables auditors to quickly determine the quality of the
boundary.  Security boundaries exist where the running code has access
to information the user does not or where the code runs with privileges
above those of the user making the request. Typical examples of such is
code that does access control or an application with the SUID bit set.

Functions which make calls to a security boundary must include
validation checks of the arguments passed. Functions which themselves
are security boundaries should audit the input received and alarm when
invoked with improper values. 

[### todo: need some examples from Subversion here...]


String operations

Use the string functions provided in apr_strings.h instead of standard
C library functions that write to strings.  The APR functions are safer
because they do bounds-checking and dest allocation automatically.
Although there may be circumstances where it's theoretically safe to
use plain C string functions (such as when you already know the
lengths of the source and dest), please use the APR functions anyway,
so the code is less brittle and more reviewable.


Password storage

Help users keep their passwords secret: When the client reads or writes
password locally, it should ensure that the file is mode 0600. If the
file is readable by other users, the client should exit with a message
that tells the user to change the filemode due to the risk of exposure.



Document everything
===================

Every function, whether public or internal, must start out with a
documentation comment that describes what the function does.  The
documentation should mention every parameter received by the function,
every possible return value, and (if not obvious) the conditions under
which the function could return an error.  Put the parameter names in
upper case in the doc string, even when they are not upper case in the
actual declaration, so that they stand out to human readers.

For public or semi-public API functions, the doc string should go
above the function in the .h file where it is declared; otherwise, it
goes above the function definition in the .c file.

For structure types, document each individual member of the structure
as well as the structure itself.

Use the doxygen (www.doxygen.org) format for interface documentation.
There is still some legacy documentation in Subversion that uses a
different style, from before we adopted doxygen, but it will
eventually be converted.  New documentation should start out in
doxygen format.

Read over the Subversion code to get an overview of how documentation
looks in practice; in particular, see subversion/include/*.h for
doxygen examples.



Using page breaks
=================

We're using page breaks (the Ctrl-L character, ASCII 12) for section
boundaries in both code and plaintext prose files.  This file is a
good example of how it's done: each section starts with a page break,
and immediately after the page break comes the title of the section.

This helps out people who use the Emacs page commands, such as
`pages-directory' and `narrow-to-page'.  Such people are not as scarce
as you might think, and if you'd like to become one of them, then add
(require 'page-ext) to your .emacs and type C-x C-p C-h sometime.



Error message conventions
=========================

For error messages the following conventions apply:

   * Provide specific error messages only when there is information 
     to add to the general error message found in 
     subversion/include/svn_error_codes.h

   * Messages start with a capital letter.

   * Try keeping messages below 70 characters.

   * Don't end the error message with a '.'.

   * Don't include newline characters in error messages.

   * Quoting information is done using single quotes ('some info').

   * Don't include the name of the function where the error occurs
     in the error message. If subversion is compiled using the
     '--enable-maintainer-mode' configure-flag, it will provide this
     information by itself.

   * When including path or filenames in the error string, be sure
     to quote them. (i.e. "Can't find '/path/to/repos/userfile'")

   * When including path or filenames in the error string, be sure
     to convert them using 'svn_path_local_style ()' before inclusion.

   * If you want to add an explanation to the error, report it
     followed by a colon and the explanation like this:
       "Invalid " SVN_PROP_EXTERNALS " property on '%s': "
       "target involves '.' or '..'"

   * Suggestions or other additions can be added after a semi-colon, 
     like this:
       "Can't write to '%s': object of same name already exists; remove "
       "before retrying"

   * Try to stay within the boundaries of these conventions, so please avoid
     separating different parts of error messages by other separators such 
     as '--' and others.

Also read the 'Localization' section elsewhere in this document.



Other conventions
=================

In addition to the GNU standards, Subversion uses these conventions:

   *  Use only spaces for indenting code, never tabs.  Tab display
      width is not standardized enough, and anyway it's easier to
      manually adjust indentation that uses spaces.

   *  Stay within 80 columns, the width of a minimal standard display
      window.

   *  Signify internal variables by two underscores after the prefix.
      That is, when a symbol must (for technical reasons) reside in the
      global namespace despite not being part of a published interface,
      then use two underscores following the module prefix.  For
      example:

         svn_fs_get_rev_prop ()       /* Part of published API. */
         svn_fs__parse_props ()       /* For internal use only. */

   *  In text strings that might be printed out (or otherwise made
      available) to users, use only forward quotes around paths and
      other quotable things.  For example:

         $ svn revert foo
         svn: warning: svn_wc_is_wc_root: 'foo' is not a versioned resource
         $ 

      There used to be a lot of strings that used a backtick for the
      first quote (`foo' instead of 'foo'), but that looked bad in
      some fonts, and also messed up some people's auto-highlighting,
      so we settled on the convention of always using forward quotes.

   *  If you use Emacs, put something like this in your .emacs file,
      so you get svn-dev.el and svnbook.el when needed:

         ;;; Begin Subversion development section
         (defun my-find-file-hook ()
           (let ((svntree-path (expand-file-name "~/projects/subversion/)))
             (if (string-match (concat svntree-path "doc/book")
                               buffer-file-name)
                 (load (concat svntree-path "doc/book/tools/svnbook"))
               (if (string-match svntree-path buffer-file-name)
                   (load (concat svntree-path "tools/dev/svn-dev"))))))
  
         (add-hook 'find-file-hooks 'my-find-file-hook)
         ;;; End Subversion development section

      You'll need to customize the path for your setup, of course.
      You can also make the regexp to string-match more selective; for
      example, one developer says:

      > Here's the regexp I'm using:
      > 
      >     "src/svn/[^/]*/\\(subversion\\|tools\\|build\\)/"
      >
      > Two things to notice there: (1) I sometimes have several
      > working copies checked out under ...src/svn, and I want the
      > regexp to match all of them; (2) I want the hook to catch only
      > in "our" directories within the working copy, so I match
      > "subversion", "tools" and "build" explicitly; I don't want to
      > use GNU style in the APR that's checked out into my repo. :-)

   *  We have a tradition of not marking files with the names of
      individual authors (i.e., we don't put lines like "Author: foo"
      or "@author foo" in a special position at the top of a source
      file).  This is to discourage territoriality -- even when a file
      has only one author, we want to make sure others feel free to
      make changes.  People might be unnecessarily hesitant if someone
      appears to have staked ownership on the file.

   *  There are many other unspoken conventions maintained throughout
      the code, that are only noticed when someone unintentionally
      fails to follow them.  Just try to have a sensitive eye for the
      way things are done, and when in doubt, ask.



APR pool usage conventions
==========================

(This assumes you already basically understand how APR pools work; see
apr_pools.h for details.)

Applications using the Subversion libraries must call apr_initialize()
before calling any Subversion functions.

Subversion's general pool usage strategy can be summed up in two
principles:

   1. The call level that created a pool is the only place to clear or
      destroy that pool.

   2. When iterating an unbounded number of times, create a subpool
      before entering the iteration, use it inside the loop and clear 
      it at the start of each iteration, then destroy it after the loop 
      is done, like so:

         subpool = svn_pool_create(pool);

         for (i = 0; i < n; ++i)
         {
           svn_pool_clear(subpool);
           do_operation(..., subpool);
         }

         svn_pool_destroy(subpool);
  
Except for some legacy code, which was written before these principles
were fully understood, virtually all pool usage in Subversion follows
the above guidelines.

One such legacy pattern is a tendency to allocate an object inside a
pool, store the pool in the object, and then free that pool (either
directly or through a close_foo() function) to destroy the object.

For example:

   /*** Example of how NOT to use pools.  Don't be like this. ***/

   static foo_t *
   make_foo_object (arg1, arg2, apr_pool_t *pool)
   {
      apr_pool_t *subpool = svn_pool_create (pool);
      foo_t *foo = apr_palloc (subpool, sizeof (*foo));

      foo->field1 = arg1;
      foo->field2 = arg2;
      foo->pool   = subpool;
   }

   [...]

   [Now some function calls make_foo_object() and returns, passing
   back a new foo object.]

   [...]

   [Now someone, at some random call level, decides that the foo's
   lifetime is over, and calls svn_pool_destroy(foo->pool).]

This is tempting, but it defeats the point of using pools, which is to
not worry so much about individual allocations, but rather about
overall performance and lifetime groups.  Instead, foo_t generally
should not have a `pool' field.  Just allocate as many foo objects as
you need in the current pool -- when that pool gets cleared or
destroyed, they will all go away simultaneously.
   
In summary:

   - Objects should not have their own pools.  An object is allocated
     into a pool defined by the constructor's caller.  The caller
     knows the lifetime of the object and will manage it via the pool.

   - Functions should not create/destroy pools for their operation;
     they should use a pool provided by the caller.  Again, the
     caller knows more about how the function will be used, how often,
     how many times, etc. thus, it should be in charge of the
     function's memory usage.

     For example, the caller might know that the app will exit upon
     the function's return. Thus, the function would create extra
     work if it built/destroyed a pool. Instead, it should use the
     passed-in pool, which the caller is going to be tossing as part
     of app-exit anyway.

   - Whenever an unbounded iteration occurs, an iteration subpool
     should be used.

   - Given all of the above, it is pretty well mandatory to pass a
     pool to every function.  Since objects are not recording pools
     for themselves, and the caller is always supposed to be managing
     memory, then each function needs a pool, rather than relying on
     some hidden magic pool.  In limited cases, objects may record the
     pool used for their construction so that they can construct
     sub-parts, but these cases should be examined carefully.

See also the section "Tracking down memory leaks" for tips on
diagnosing pool usage problems.



APR status codes
=================

Always check for APR status codes (except APR_SUCCESS) with the
APR_STATUS_IS_...() macros, not by direct comparison. This is
required for portability to non-Unix platforms.



Exception handling
==================

OK, here's how to use exceptions in Subversion.

1.  Exceptions are stored in svn_error_t structures:

typedef struct svn_error
{
  apr_status_t apr_err;      /* APR error value, possibly SVN_ custom err */
  const char *message;       /* details from producer of error */
  struct svn_error *child;   /* ptr to the error we "wrap" */
  ap_pool_t *pool;           /* place to generate message strings from */
  const char *file;          /* Only used iff SVN_DEBUG */
  long line;                 /* Only used iff SVN_DEBUG */
} svn_error_t;

2.  If you are the *original* creator of an error, you would do
    something like this:

        return svn_error_create (SVN_ERR_FOO, NULL, 
                                 "User not permitted to write file");


    NOTICE the NULL field... indicating that this error has no child,
    i.e. it is the bottom-most error.

    A section on writing error messages can be found elsewhere in this 
    document under the title 'Error message conventions'.

    Subversion internally uses UTF-8 to store its data. This also applies
    to the 'message' string. APR is assumed to return its data in the current
    locale, so any text returned by APR needs conversion to UTF-8 before
    inclusion in the message string.

3.  If you *receive* an error, you have three choices:

    a) Handle the error yourself.  Use either your own code, or just
       call the primitive svn_handle_error(err).  (This routine unwinds
       the error stack and prints out messages converting them from UTF-8
       to the current locale.)

       When your routine receives an error which it intends to ignore or 
       handle itself, be sure to clean it up using svn_error_clear(). Any
       time such an error is not cleared constitutes a *memory leak*.

    b) Throw the error upwards, unmodified:

        error = some_routine (foo);
        if (error)
          return (error);

       Actually, a better way to do this would be with the SVN_ERR() macro, 
       which does the same thing:

       SVN_ERR (some_routine (foo));

    c) Throw the error upwards, wrapping it in a new error structure
       by including it as the "child" argument:

        error = some_routine (foo);
        if (error)
          {
           svn_error_t *wrapper = svn_error_create (SVN_ERR_FOO, error,
                                                    "Authorization failed");
           return wrapper;
          }

        Of course, there's a convenience routine which creates a
        wrapper error with the same fields as the child, except for your
        custom message:

        error = some_routine (foo);
        if (error)
          {
           return svn_error_quick_wrap (error, 
                                        "Authorization failed");
          }

        The same can (and should) be done by using the SVN_ERR_W() macro:

          SVN_ERR_W (some_routine (foo),
                     "Authorization failed");

    In cases (b) and (c) it is important to know that resources allocated by
    your routine which are associated with a pool, are automatically cleaned
    up when the pool is destroyed. This means that there is no need to
    cleanup these resources before passing the error. There is therefore no
    reason not to use the SVN_ERR() and SVN_ERR_W() macros.

    Resources associated with pools are:

      * Memory

      * Files
        All files opened with apr_file_open are closed at pool 
        cleanup. Subversion uses this function in its svn_io_file_* api, 
        which means that files opened with svn_io_file_* or apr_file_open
        will be closed at pool cleanup.

        Some files (lock files for example) need to be removed when an 
        operation is finished. APR has the APR_DELONCLOSE flag for
        this purpose. The following functions create files which are
        removed on pool cleanup:
        - apr_file_open and svn_io_file_open (when passed the 
          APR_DELONCLOSE flag)
        - svn_io_open_unique_file (when passed TRUE in its delete_on_close)
        
        Locked files are unlocked if they were locked using svn_io_file_lock.



Automated tests
===============

For a description of how to use and add tests to Subversion's
automated test framework, please read 'subversion/tests/README'.



Writing test cases before code
==============================

From: Karl Fogel <kfogel@collab.net>
Subject: writing test cases
To: dev@subversion.tigris.org
Date: Mon, 5 Mar 2001 15:58:46 -0600

Many of us implementing the filesystem interface have now gotten into
the habit of writing the test cases (see fs-test.c) *before* writing
the actual code.  It's really helping us out a lot -- for one thing,
it forces one to define the task precisely in advance, and also it
speedily reveals the bugs in one's first try (and second, and
third...).

I'd like to recommend this practice to everyone.  If you're
implementing an interface, or adding an entirely new feature, or even
just fixing a bug, a test for it is a good idea.  And if you're going
to write the test anyway, you might as well write it first. :-)

Yoshiki Hayashi's been sending test cases with all his patches lately,
which is what inspired me to write this mail to encourage everyone to
do the same.  Having those test cases makes patches easier to examine,
because they show the patch's purpose very clearly.  It's like having
a second log message, one whose accuracy is verified at run-time.

That said, I don't think we want a rigid policy about this, at least
not yet.  If you encounter a bug somewhere in the code, but you only
have time to write a patch with no test case, that's okay -- having
the patch is still useful; someone else can write the test case.

As Subversion gets more complex, though, the automated test suite gets
more crucial, so let's all get in the habit of using it early.

Debugging the server
====================

Debugging the ra_dav server
---------------------------

'mod_dav_svn.so' contains the main Subversion server logic; it runs as
a module within mod_dav, which runs as a module within httpd.  Since
httpd is probably using dynamic shared modules, you normally won't be
able to set breakpoints in advance when you start Apache in a debugger
such as GDB.  Instead, you'll need to start up, then interrupt httpd,
set your breakpoint, and continue:

   % gdb httpd
   (gdb) run -X
   ^C
   (gdb) break some_func_in_mod_dav_svn
   (gdb) continue

The -X switch is equivalent to -DONE_PROCESS and -DNO_DETACH, which
ensure that httpd runs as a single thread and remains attached to the
tty, respectively.  As soon as it starts, it sits and waits for
requests; that's when you hit control-C and set your breakpoint.

You'll probably want to watch Apache's run-time logs

   /usr/local/apache2/logs/error_log
   /usr/local/apache2/logs/access_log

to help determine what might be going wrong and where to set
breakpoints.


Debugging the ra_svn client and server, on Unix
-----------------------------------------------

Bugs in ra_svn usually manifest themselves with one of the following
cryptic error messages:

  svn: Malformed network data
  svn: Connection closed unexpectedly

(The first message can also mean the data stream was corrupted in
tunnel mode by user dotfiles or hook scripts; see issue 1145.)  The
first message generally means you to have to debug the client; the
second message generally means you have to debug the server.

It is easiest to debug ra_svn using a build with --disable-shared
--enable-maintainer-mode.  With the latter option, the error message
will tell you exactly what line to set a breakpoint at; otherwise,
look up the line number at the end of marshal.c:vparse_tuple() where
it returns the "Malformed network data" error.

To debug the client, simply pull it up in gdb, set a breakpoint, and
run the offending command:

  % gdb svn
  (gdb) break marshal.c:NNN
  (gdb) run ARGS
  Breakpoint 1, vparse_tuple (list=___, pool=___, fmt=___, 
    ap=___) at subversion/libsvn_ra_svn/marshal.c:NNN
  NNN                                 "Malformed network data");

There are several bits of useful information:

  * A backtrace will tell you exactly what protocol exchange is
    failing.

  * "print *conn" will show you the connection buffer.  read_buf,
    read_ptr, and read_end represent the read buffer, which can show
    you the data the marshaller is looking at.  (Since read_buf isn't
    generally 0-terminated at read_end, be careful of falsely assuming
    that there's garbage data in the buffer.)

  * The format string determines what the marshaller was expecting to
    see.

To debug the server in daemon mode, pull it up in gdb, set a
breakpoint (usually a "Connection closed unexpectedly" error on the
client indicates a "Malformed network data" error on the server,
although it can also indicate a core dump), and run it with the "-X"
option to serve a single connection:

  % gdb svnserve
  (gdb) break marshal.c:NNN
  (gdb) run -X

Then run the offending client command.  From there, it's just like
debugging the client.

Debugging the server in tunnel mode is more of a pain.  You'll need to
stick something like "{ int x = 1; while (x); }" near the top of
svnserve's main() and put the resulting svnserve in the user path on
the server.  Then start an operation, gdb attach the process on the
server, "set x = 0", and step through the code as desired.



Tracking down memory leaks
==========================

Our use of APR pools makes it unusual for us to have memory leaks in
the strictest sense; all the memory we allocate will be cleaned up
eventually.  But sometimes an operation takes more memory than it
should; for instance, a checkout of a large source tree should not use
much more memory than a checkout of a small source tree.  When that
happens, it generally means we're allocating memory from a pool whose
lifetime is too long.

If you have a favorite memory leak tracking tool, you can configure
with --enable-pool-debug (which will make every pool allocation use
its own malloc()), arrange to exit in the middle of the operation, and
go to it.  If not, here's another way:

  * Configure with --enable-pool-debug=verbose-alloc.  Make sure to
    rebuild all of APR and Subversion so that every allocation gets
    file-and-line information.

  * Run the operation, piping stderr to a file.  Hopefully you have
    lots of disk space.

  * In the file, you'll see lots of lines which look like:

    POOL DEBUG: [5383/1024] PCALLOC (      2763/      2763/      5419) 0x08102D48 "subversion/clients/cmdline/main.c:612" <subversion/libsvn_subr/auth.c:122> (118/118/0)

    What you care about most is the tenth field (the one in quotes),
    which gives you the file and line number where the pool for this
    allocation was created.  Go to that file and line and determine
    the lifetime of the pool.  In the example above, main.c:612
    indicates that this allocation was made in the top-level pool of
    the svn client.  If this were an allocation which was repeated
    many times during the course of an operation, that would indicate
    a source of a memory leak.  The eleventh field (the one in
    brackets) gives the file and line number of the allocation itself.



Writing log messages
====================

Certain guidelines should be adhered to when writing log messages:

Make a log message for every change.  The value of the log becomes
much less if developers cannot rely on its completeness.  Even if
you've only changed comments, write a log that says "Doc fix." or
something.

Start off the log message with one line indicating the general nature
of the change.  This not only helps put developers in the right frame
of mind for reading the rest of the log message, but also plays well
with the "CIA" bot that echoes the first line of each commit to
realtime forums like IRC.  (See http://cia.navi.cx/ for details.)

Use full sentences, not sentence fragments.  Fragments are more often
ambiguous, and it takes only a few more seconds to write out what you
mean.  Fragments like "Doc fix", "New file", or "New function" are
acceptable because they are standard idioms, and all further details
should appear in the source code.

The log message should name every affected function, variable, macro,
makefile target, grammar rule, etc, including the names of symbols
that are being removed in this commit.  This helps people searching
through the logs later.  Don't hide names in wildcards, because the
globbed portion may be what someone searches for later.  For example,
this is bad:

   * twirl.c
     (twirling_baton_*): Removed these obsolete structures.
     (handle_parser_warning): Pass data directly to callees, instead
     of storing in twirling_baton_*.

   * twirl.h: Fix indentation.

Later on, when someone is trying to figure out what happened to
`twirling_baton_fast', they may not find it if they just search for
"_fast".  A better entry would be:

   * twirl.c 
     (twirling_baton_fast, twirling_baton_slow): Removed these
     obsolete structures. 
     (handle_parser_warning): Pass data directly to callees, instead
     of storing in twirling_baton_*. 

   * twirl.h: Fix indentation.

The wildcard is okay in the description for `handle_parser_warning',
but only because the two structures were mentioned by full name
elsewhere in the log entry.

Note how each file gets its own entry prefixed with an "*", and the
changes within a file are grouped by symbol, with the symbols listed
in parentheses followed by a colon, followed by text describing the
change.  Please adhere to this format -- not only does consistency aid
readability, it also allows software to colorize log entries
automatically.

If your change is related to a specific issue in the issue tracker,
then include a string like "issue #N" in the log message.  For
example, if a patch resolves issue 1729, then the log message might
be:

   Fix issue #1729: Don't crash because of a missing file.

   * get_editor.c
     (frobnicate_file): Check that file exists before frobnicating.

For large changes or change groups, group the log entry into
paragraphs separated by blank lines.  Each paragraph should be a set
of changes that accomplishes a single goal, and each group should
start with a sentence or two summarizing the change.  Truly
independent changes should be made in separate commits, of course.

One should never need the log entries to understand the current code.
If you find yourself writing a significant explanation in the log, you
should consider carefully whether your text doesn't actually belong in
a comment, alongside the code it explains.  Here's an example of doing
it right:

   (consume_count): If `count' is unreasonable, return 0 and don't
   advance input pointer.

And then, in `consume_count' in `cplus-dem.c':

   while (isdigit ((unsigned char)**type))
     {
       count *= 10;
       count += **type - '0';
       /* A sanity check.  Otherwise a symbol like
         `_Utf390_1__1_9223372036854775807__9223372036854775'
         can cause this function to return a negative value.
         In this case we just consume until the end of the string.  */
      if (count > strlen (*type))
        {
          *type = save;
          return 0;
        }

This is why a new function, for example, needs only a log entry saying
"New Function" --- all the details should be in the source.

There are some common-sense exceptions to the need to name everything
that was changed:

   *  If you have made a change which requires trivial changes
      throughout the rest of the program (e.g., renaming a variable),
      you needn't name all the functions affected, you can just say
      "All callers changed".

   *  If you have rewritten a file completely, the reader understands
      that everything in it has changed, so your log entry may simply
      give the file name, and say "Rewritten".

   *  If your change was only to one file, or was the same change to
      multiple files, then there's no need to list their paths in the
      log message (because "svn log" can show the changed paths for
      that revision anyway).  Only when you need to describe how the
      change affected different areas in different ways is it
      necessary to organize the log message by paths and symbols, as
      in the examples above.

   *  If your change was to multiple files, provide a brief summary of
      the change at the top of the log message (before the paths and
      symbols list).

In general, there is a tension between making entries easy to find by
searching for identifiers, and wasting time or producing unreadable
entries by being exhaustive.  Use your best judgment --- and be
considerate of your fellow developers.  (Also, run "svn log" to see
how others have been writing their log entries.)



Patch submission guidelines
===========================

Mail patches to `dev@subversion.tigris.org', with a subject line
that contains the word "PATCH" in all uppercase, for example

   Subject: [PATCH] fix for rev printing bug in svn status

A patch submission should contain one logical change; please don't mix
N unrelated changes in one submission -- send N separate emails
instead.

The email message should start off with a log message, as described in
"Writing log messages" above.  The patch itself should be in unified
diff format (e.g., with "svn diff"), preferably inserted directly into
the body of your message (rather than MIME-attached, uuencoded, or
otherwise opaqified).  If your mailer wraps long lines, then you will
need to attach your patch.  Please ensure the MIME type of the attachment
is text/plain (some mailers allow you to set the MIME type; for some
others, you might have to use a .txt extension on your patch file). Do
not compress or otherwise encode the attached patch.

If the patch implements a new feature, make sure to describe the
feature completely in your mail; if the patch fixes a bug, describe
the bug in detail and give a reproduction recipe.  An exception to
these guidelines is when the patch addresses a specific issue in the
issues database -- in that case, just make sure to refer to the issue
number in your log message, as described in "Writing log messages".

It is normal for patches to undergo several rounds of feedback and
change before being applied.  Don't be discouraged if your patch is
not accepted immediately -- it doesn't mean you goofed, it just means
that there are a *lot* of eyes looking at every code submission, and
it's a rare patch that doesn't have at least a little room for
improvement.  After reading people's responses to your patch, make the
appropriate changes and resubmit, wait for the next round of feedback,
and lather, rinse, repeat, until some committer applies it.

If you don't get a response for a while, and don't see the patch
applied, it may just mean that people are really busy.  Go ahead and
repost, and don't hesitate to point out that you're still waiting for
a response.  One way to think of it is that patch management is highly
parallizable, and we need you to shoulder your share of the management
as well as the coding.  Every patch needs someone to shepherd it
through the process, and the person best qualified to do that is the
original submitter.

The "Patch Manager" Role:
-------------------------

Subversion usually has a Patch Manager, whose job is to watch the dev@
mailing list and make sure that no patches "slip through the cracks".

This means watching every thread containing "[PATCH]" mails, and
taking appropriate action based on the progress of the thread.  If the
thread resolves on its own (because the patch gets committed, or
because there is consensus that the patch doesn't need to be applied,
or whatever) then no further action need be taken.  But if the thread
fades out without any clear decision, then the patch needs to be saved
in the issue tracker.  This means that a summary of any discussion
threads around that patch, and links to relevant mailing list
archives, will be added to some issue in the tracker.  For a patch
which addresses an existing issue tracker item, the patch is saved to
that item.  Otherwise, a new issue of type 'PATCH' is filed, and the
patch is saved to that new issue.

The Patch Manager needs a basic technical understanding of Subversion,
and the ability to skim a thread and get a rough understanding of
whether consensus has been reached, and if so, of what kind.  It does
*not* require actual Subversion development experience or commit
access.  Expertise in using one's mail reading software is optional,
but recommended :-).

The current patch manager is Michael Thelen <thelenm@cs.utah.edu>.


Filing bugs / issues
====================

This pretty much says it all:

   From: Karl Fogel <kfogel@collab.net>
   Subject: Please ask on the list before filing a new issue.
   To: dev@subversion.tigris.org
   Date: Tue, 30 Jul 2002 10:51:24 (CDT)
   
   Folks, we're getting tons of new issues, which is a Good Thing in
   general, but some of them don't really belong in the issue tracker.
   They're things that would be better solved by a quick conversation
   here on the dev list.  Compilation problems, behavior questions,
   feature ideas that have been discussed before, that sort of thing.
   
   *Please* be more conservative about filing issues.  The issues
   database is physically much more cumbersome than email.  It wastes
   people's time to have conversations in the issues database that should
   be had in email.  (This is not a libel against the issue tracker, it's
   just a result of the fact that the issues database is for permanent
   storage and flow annotation, not for real-time conversation.)
   
   If you encounter a situation where Subversion is clearly behaving
   wrongly, or behaving opposite to what the documentation says, then
   it's okay to file the issue right away (after searching to make sure
   it isn't already filed, of course!).  But if you're
   
      a) Requesting a new feature, or
      b) Having build problems, or
      c) Not sure what the behavior should be, or
      d) Disagreeing with current intended behavior, or
      e) Not TOTALLY sure that others would agree this is a bug, or
      f) For any reason at all not sure this should be filed,
   
   ...then please post to the dev list first.  You'll get a faster
   response, and others won't be forced to use the issues database to
   have the initial real-time conversations.
   
   Nothing is lost this way.  If we eventually conclude that it should be
   in the issue tracker, then we can still file it later, after the
   description and reproduction recipe have been honed on the dev list.
   
   Thank you,
   -Karl

   

Commit access
=============

There are two types of commit access: full and partial.  Full means
anywhere in the tree, partial means only in that committer's specific
area(s) of expertise.  The COMMITTERS file lists all committers, both
full and partial, and says the domains for each partial committer.

How full commit access is granted:

After someone has successfully contributed a few non-trivial patches,
some full committer, usually whoever has reviewed and applied the most
patches from that contributor, proposes them for commit access.  This
proposal is sent only to the other full committers -- the ensuing
discussion is private, so that everyone can feel comfortable speaking
their minds.  Assuming there are no objections, the contributor is
granted commit access.  The decision is made by consensus; there are
no formal rules governing the procedure, though generally if someone
strongly objects the access is not offered, or is offered on a
provisional basis.

The criteria for commit access are that the person's patches adhere to
the guidelines in this file, adhere to all the usual unquantifiable
rules of coding (code should be readable, robust, maintainable, etc),
and that the person respects the "Hippocratic Principle": first, do no
harm.  In other words, what is significant is not the size or quantity
of patches submitted, but the degree of care shown in avoiding bugs
and minimizing unnecessary impact on the rest of the code.  Many full
committers are people who have not made major code contributions, but
rather lots of small, clean fixes, each of which was an unambiguous
improvement to the code.

How partial commit access is granted:

A full committer sponsors the partial committer.  Usually this means
the full committer has applied several patches to the same area from
the proposed partial committer, and realizes things would be easier if
the person were just committing directly.  Approval is not required
from the full committers; it is assumed that sponsors know what
they're doing and will watch the partial committer's first few commits
to make sure everything's going smoothly.



The configuration/build system under unix
=========================================

Greg Stein wrote a custom build system for Subversion, which had been
using `automake' and recursive Makefiles.  Now it uses a single,
top-level Makefile, generated from Makefile.in (which is kept under
revision control).  `Makefile.in' in turn includes `build-outputs.mk',
which is automatically generated from `build.conf' by the
`gen-make.py' script.  Thus, the latter two are under revision
control, but `build-outputs.mk' is not.

Here is Greg's original mail describing the system, followed by some
advice about hacking it:

   From: Greg Stein <gstein@lyra.org>
   Subject:  new build system (was: Re: CVS update: MODIFIED: ac-helpers ...)

   Okay... this is it. We're now on the build system.

       "It works on my machine."

   I suspect there may be some tweaks to make on different OSs. I'd be
   interested to hear if Ben can really build with normal BSD make. It
   should be possible.

   The code supports building, installation, checking, and
   dependencies. It does *NOT* yet deal with the doc/ subdirectory. That
   is next; I figured this could be rolled out and get the kinks worked
   out while I do the doc/ stuff.  Oh, it doesn't build Neon or APR yet
   either. I also saw a problem where libsvn_fs wasn't getting built
   before linking one of the test proggies (see below).

   Basic operation: same as before.

   $ ./autogen.sh
   $ ./configure OPTIONS
   $ make
   $ make check
   $ make install

   There are some "make check" scripts that need to be fixed up. That'll
   happen RSN. Some of them create their own log, rather than spewing to
   stdout (where the top-level make will place the output into
   [TOP]/tests.log).

   The old Makefile.am files are still around, but I'll be tossing those
   along with a bunch of tweaks to all the .cvsignore files. There are a
   few other cleanups, too. But that can happen as a step two.

   [ $ cvs rm -f `find . -name Makefile.rm`

     See the mistake in that line? I didn't when I typed it. The find
     returned nothing, so cvs rm -f proceeded to delete my entire
     tree. And the -f made sure to delete all my source files, too. Good
     fugging thing that I had my mods in some Emacs buffers, or I'd be
     bitching.

     I am *so* glad that Ben coded SVN to *not* delete locally modified
     files *and* that we have an "undel" command. I had to go and tweak a
     bazillion Entries files to undo the delete...
   ]

   The top-level make has a number of shortcuts in it (well, actually in
   build-outputs.mk):

   $ make subversion/libsvn_fs/libsvn_fs.la

   or

   $ make libsvn_fs

   The two are the same. So... when your test proggie fails to link
   because libsvn_fs isn't around, just run "make libsvn_fs" to build it
   immediately, then go back to the regular "make".

   Note that the system still conditionally builds the FS stuff based
   on whether DB (See 'Building on Unix' below) is available, and
   mod_dav_svn if Apache is available.

   Handy hint: if you don't like dependencies, then you can do:

   $ ./autogen.sh -s

   That will skip the dependency generation that goes into
   build-outputs.mk. It makes the script run quite a bit faster (48 secs
   vs 2 secs on my poor little Pentium 120).

   Note that if you change build.conf, you can simply run:

   $ ./gen-make.py build.conf

   to regen build-outputs.mk. You don't have to go back through the whole
   autogen.sh / configure process.

   You should also note that autogen.sh and configure run much faster now
   that we don't have the automake crap. Oh, and our makefiles never
   re-run configure on you out of the blue (gawd, I hated when automake
   did that to me).

   Obviously, there are going to be some tweaky things going on. I also
   think that the "shadow" builds or whatever they're called (different
   source and build dirs) are totally broken. Something tweaky will have
   to happen there.  But, thankfully, we only have one Makefile to deal
   with.

   Note that I arrange things so that we have one generated file
   (build-outputs.mk), and one autoconf-generated file (Makefile from
   .in).  I also tried to shove as much logic/rules into
   Makefile.in. Keeping build-outputs.mk devoid of rules (thus, implying
   gen-make.py devoid of rules in its output generation) manes that
   tweaking rules in Makefile.in is much more approachable to people.

   I think that is about it. Send problems to the dev@ list and/or feel
   free to dig in and fix them yourself. My next steps are mostly
   cleanup. After that, I'm going to toss out our use of libtool and rely
   on APR's libtool setup (no need for us to replicate what APR already
   did).

   Cheers,

And here is some advice for those changing or testing the
configuration/build system:

   From: Karl Fogel <kfogel@collab.net>
   To: dev@subversion.tigris.org
   Subject: when changing build/config stuff, always do this first
   Date: Wed 28 Nov 2001

   Yo everyone: if you change part of the configuration/build system,
   please make sure to clean out any old installed Subversion libs
   *before* you try building with your changes.  If you don't do this,
   your changes may appear to work fine, when in fact they would fail if
   run on a truly pristine system.

   This script demonstrates what I mean by "clean out".  This is
   `/usr/local/cleanup.sh' on my system.  It cleans out the Subversion
   libs (and the installed httpd-2.0 libs, since I'm often reinstalling
   that too):

      #!/bin/sh

      # Take care of libs
      cd /usr/local/lib
      rm -f APRVARS
      rm -f libapr*
      rm -f libexpat*
      rm -f libneon*
      rm -f libsvn*

      # Take care of headers
      cd /usr/local/include
      rm -f apr*
      rm -f svn*
      rm -f neon/*

      # Take care of headers
      cd /usr/local/apache2/lib
      rm -f *

   When someone reports a configuration bug and you're trying to
   reproduce it, run this first. :-)

   The voice of experience,
   -Karl



How to release a distribution tarball
====================================

See notes/releases.txt.



Release numbering, compatibility, and deprecation
=================================================

Subversion uses "MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH" release numbers, with the same
guidelines as APR (see http://apr.apache.org/versioning.html), plus a
few extensions, described later.  The general idea is:

   1) Upgrading/downgrading between different patch releases in the
      same MAJOR.MINOR line never breaks code.  It may cause bugfixes
      to disappear/reappear, but API signatures and semantics remain
      the same.  (Of course, the semantics may change in the trivial
      ways appropriate for bugfixes, just not in ways that would force
      adjustments in calling code.)

   2) Upgrading to a new minor release in the same major line may
      cause new APIs to appear, but not remove any APIs.  Any code
      written to the old minor number will work with any later minor
      number in that line.  However, downgrading afterwards may not
      work, if new code has been written that takes advantage of the
      new APIs.

   3) When the major number changes, all bets are off.  This is the
      only opportunity for a full reset of the APIs, and while we try
      not to gratuitously remove interfaces, we will use it to clean
      house a bit.

Subversion extends the APR guidelines to cover client/server
compatibility questions:

 1. A patch or minor number release of a server (or client) never
    breaks compatibility with a client (or server) in the same major
    line.  However, new features offered by the release might be
    unsupported without a corresponding upgrade to the other side of
    the connection.  For updating ra_svn code specifically, please
    observe these principles:

    (a) Fields can be added to any tuple; old clients will simply
        ignore them.  (Right now, the marshalling implementation does
        not let you put number or boolean values in the optional part
        of a tuple, but changing that will not affect the protocol.)
   
        We can use this mechanism when information is added to an API
        call.
   
    (b) At connection establishment time, clients and servers exchange
        a list of capability keywords.
   
        We can use this mechanism for more complicated changes, like
        introducing pipelining or removing information from API calls.
   
    (c) New commands can be added; trying to use an unsupported
        command will result in an error which can be checked and dealt
        with.
   
    (d) The protocol version number can be bumped to allow graceful
        refusal of old clients or servers, or to allow a client or
        server to detect when it has to do things the old way.
 
        This mechanism is a last resort, to be used when capability
        keywords would be too hard to manage.

 2. Working copy and repository formats are backward- and
    forward-compatible for all patch releases in the same minor
    series.  They are backward-compatible for all minor releases in
    the same major series; however, a minor release is allowed to make
    a working copy or repository that doesn't work with previous minor
    releases, where "make" could mean "upgrade" as well as "create".

Subversion does not use the "even==stable, odd==unstable" convention;
any unqualified triplet indicates a stable release:

   1.0.1  -->  first stable patch release of 1.0
   1.1.0  -->  next stable minor release of 1.x after 1.0.x
   1.1.1  -->  first stable patch release of 1.1.x
   1.1.2  -->  second stable patch release of 1.1.x
   1.2.0  -->  next stable minor release after that

The order of releases is semi-nonlinear -- a 1.0.3 *might* come out
after a 1.1.0.  But it's only "semi"-nonlinear because eventually we
declare a patch line defunct and tell people to upgrade to the next
minor release, so over the long run the numbering is basically linear.

Non-stable releases are qualified with "alphaN" or "betaN" suffixes,
and release candidates with "-rcN".  For example, the prereleases
leading to 1.3.7 might look like this:

   subversion-1.3.7-rc1.tar.gz
   subversion-1.3.7-rc2.tar.gz
   subversion-1.3.7-rc3.tar.gz
   subversion-1.3.7.tar.gz

The output of 'svn --version' corresponds in the obvious way:

   version 1.3.7 (Release Candidate 1)
   version 1.3.7 (Release Candidate 2)
   version 1.3.7 (Release Candidate 3)
   version 1.3.7

When you 'make install' subversion-1.3.7-rc1, it still installs as
though it were "1.3.7", of course.  The qualifiers are metadata on the
release; we want each subsequent prerelease release to overwrite the
previous one, and the final release to overwrite the last prerelease.

For working copy builds, there is no tarball name to worry about, but
'svn --version' still produces special output:

   version 1.3.7 (dev build, rXXXX)

The "rXXXX" is not important (if it proves difficult to implement, we
may omit it).  The important thing is to say "dev build".  This
indicates that the build came from a working copy, which is useful in
bug reports.

We have no mechanism for releasing dated snapshots.  If we want code
to get wider distribution than just those who build from working
copies, we put out a prerelease.

Deprecation:
------------

When a new, improved version of an API is introduced, the old one
remains for compatibility, at least until the next major release.
However, we mark the old one as deprecated and point to the new one,
so people know to write to the new API if at all possible.  When
deprecating, mention the release after which the deprecation was
introduced, and point to the new API.  If possible, replace the old
API documentation with a diff to the new one.  For example:

   /**
    * @deprecated Provided for backward compatibility with the 1.0.0 API.
    *
    * Similar to svn_repos_dump_fs2(), but with the @a use_deltas
    * parameter always set to @c FALSE.
    */
   svn_error_t *svn_repos_dump_fs (svn_repos_t *repos,
                                   svn_stream_t *dumpstream,
                                   svn_stream_t *feedback_stream,
                                   svn_revnum_t start_rev,
                                   svn_revnum_t end_rev,
                                   svn_boolean_t incremental,
                                   svn_cancel_func_t cancel_func,
                                   void *cancel_baton,
                                   apr_pool_t *pool);

When the major release number changes, the "best" new API in a series
generally replaces all the previous ones (assuming it subsumes their
functionality), and it will take the name of the original API.  Thus,
marking 'svn_repos_dump_fs' as deprecated in 1.1.x doesn't mean that
2.0.0 doesn't have 'svn_repos_dump_fs', it just means the function's
signature will be different: it will have the signature held by
svn_repos_dump_fs2 (or svn_repos_dump_fs3, or whatever) in 1.1.x.  The
numbered-suffix names disappear, and there is a single (shiny, new)
svn_repos_dump_fs again.

One exception to this replacement strategy is when the old function
has a totally unsatisfying name anyway.  Deprecation is a chance to
fix that: we give the new API a totally new name, mark the old API as
deprecated, point to the new API; then at the major version change, we
remove the old API, but don't rename the new one to the old name,
because its new name is fine.
   


Stabilizing and maintaining releases
====================================

Minor and major number releases go through a stabilization period
before release, and remain in maintenance (bugfix) mode after release.
To start the release process, we create a "A.B.x" branch based on the
previous release, for example:

   $ svn cp http://svn.collab.net/repos/svn/tags/A.(B-1).C \
            http://svn.collab.net/repos/svn/branches/A.B.x

The main difference between "stabilization" and "maintenance" is that
the stabilization involves a four week soak period before the first
release of the new line (A.B.0).  The soak period is to make sure that
no surprise showstopper bugs are lurking.  A "showstopper" means a
non-edge-case crash, a data corruption problem, a major security hole,
or something equally serious.  In the unlikely event that the full
committers cannot agree on whether a bug is showstopper, they vote.

A major or minor release soak starts with A.B.0-rc1.  There will only
be an A.B.0-rc2 and higher if necessary, as each such release restarts
the soak period.  Once A.B.0 is out, subsequent releases in that line
do not require a four week soak, because only conservative changes go
into the line.

Certain kinds of commits can into A.B.0 without restarting the soak
period, or into a later release without affecting the testing schedule
or release date:

   Without voting:
     - Changes to the STATUS file.
     - Documentation file changes, including to the book, README,
       INSTALL, HACKING, www/, etc. 
     - Changes that are a normal part of release bookkeeping, for
       example, the steps listed in notes/releases.txt.
     - Changes to dist.sh by, or approved by, the release manager.
     - Changes to message translations in .po files as long as format string
       "%" codes are not touched.
   With voting:
     - Anything affecting only tools/, packages/, or bindings/.
     - Doc fixes in core code header or source files.
     - Changes to printed output, such as error and usage messages, as
       long as format string "%" codes and their args are not touched.
     - Changes to message translations in .po files with changes to format
       "%" codes.

NOTE: The requirements on message translation changes are looser than for
text messages in C code.  This is so a translator can fix typos and other
errors without requiring voting.  Changing format specifiers in .po files
is allowed because their validity can be checked mechanically (with the
-c flag on msgfmt of GNU gettext).  If this checking is forgotten, however,
such changes can introduce crashes, so they still require voting.

Core code changes, of course, require voting, and restart the soak or
test period, since otherwise the change could be undertested.

The voting system works like this:

A change to the A.B.x line must be first proposed in the A.B.x/STATUS
file.  Each proposal consists of a short identifying block (e.g., the
revision number of a trunk or related-line commit, or perhaps an issue
number), a brief description of the change, an at-most-one-line
justification of why it should be in A.B.x, perhaps some
notes/concerns, and finally the votes.  The notes and concerns are
meant to be brief summaries to help a reader get oriented; please
don't use the STATUS file for actual discussion, use dev@ instead.

Here's an example, probably as complex as an entry would ever get:

   * r98765 (issue #56789)
     Make commit editor take a closure object for future mindreading.
     Justification: API stability, as prep for future enhancement.
     Notes: There was consensus on the desirability of this feature in
       the near future; see thread at http://... (Message-Id: blahblah).
     Concerns: Vetoed by jerenkrantz due to privacy concerns with the
       implementation; see thread at http://... (Message-Id: blahblah)
     Votes:
       +1: ghudson, bliss
       +0: cmpilato
       -0: gstein
       -1: jerenkrantz

A change needs three +1 votes from full committers (or partial
committers for the involved areas), and no vetoes, to go into A.B.x.

If you cast a veto (i.e. -1), please state the reason in the concerns
field, and include a url / message-id for the list discussion if any.
You can go back and add the link later if the thread isn't available
at the time you commit the veto.

Voting +1 on a change doesn't just mean you approve of it in principle.
It means you have thoroughly reviewed the change, and find it correct
and as nondisruptive as possible.  When it is committed to the release
branch, the log message will include the names of all who voted for
it, as well as the original author and the person making the commit.
All of these people are considered equally answerable for bugs.

If you've reviewed a patch, and like it but have some reservations,
you can write "+1 (concept)" and then ask questions on the list about
your concerns.  You can write "+0" if you like the general idea but
haven't reviewed the patch carefully.  Neither of these votes counts
toward the total, but they can be useful for tracking down people who
are following the change and might be willing to spend more time on
it.

There is a somewhat looser voting system for the tools/, packages/,
and bindings/ areas, because they are not core code, and because there
are usually fewer experts available to review changes there.  A change
in these areas can go in with a +1 from a full committer or a partial
committer for that area, at least one +0 or "concept +1" from any
other committer, and no vetoes.  (If a change affects the build
system, however, it is considered a core change, and needs three
+1's.)  Use your judgment and don't review changes unless you have
some competence to do so, of course.  The goal is to get at least two
pairs of eyes on the change, without demanding that every reviewer
have the same amount of expertise as the area maintainer.  This way
one can review for general sanity, accurate comments, obvious
mistakes, etc, without being forced to assert "Yes, I understand these
changes in every detail and have tested them."


Localization (l10n)
===================

Translation has been divided into two domains.  First there is the
translation of server messages sent to connecting clients.  This issue
has been punted for now.  Second there is the translation of the
client and its libraries.

The gettext package provides services for translating messages.  It
uses the xgettext tool to extract strings from the sources for
translation.  This works by extracting the arguments of the _() and
N_() macros.  The former is used in context where function calls are
allowed (typically anything except static initializers).  The latter
is used whenever _() isn't.  Strings marked with N_() need to be
passed to gettext translation routines whenever referenced in the
code.  For an example, look at how the header and footer are handled
in subversion/clients/cmdline/help-cmd.c.

When using direct calls to gettext routines (*gettext or *dgettext),
keep in mind that most of Subversion code is library code.  Therefore
the default domain is not necessarily Subversion's own domain.  In
library code you should use the dgettext versions of the gettext
functions.  The domain name is defined in the PACKAGE_NAME define.

All required setup for localization is controlled by the ENABLE_NLS
conditional in svn_private_config.h (for *nix) and
svn_private_config.hw (for Windows).  Be sure to put

   #include "svn_private_config.h"

as the last include in any file which requires localization.

Also note that return values of _() and *gettext() calls are UTF-8
encoded; this means that they should be translated to the current
locale being written as any form of program output.

The GNU gettext manual
(http://www.gnu.org/software/gettext/manual/html_node/gettext_toc.html)
provides additional information on writing translatable programs in its
section "Preparing Program Sources". Its hints mainly apply to string
composition.
