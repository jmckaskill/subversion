   Oh Most High and Puissant Emacs, please be in -*- outline -*- mode!

Some ideas for the future.

* todo: move the ideas in doc/future.texi to here

  Because plaintext/outline is less of a barrier to adding new ideas
  than texinfo format; this should be a pretty informal file.

* shell-like interactive mode for client (like ftp)

  Subject: A feature request for command line client
  To: dev@subversion.tigris.org

  I know people are beginning to work on the command line client, so I
  hope Im not too late with this request.
  
  Basically I would like svn to behave like ftp (actually more like lftp
  or ncftp).
  
  What this means is that if you type just "svn<return>" you get dropped
  into an interactive svn shell where you can type a litany of commands.
  Preferably this happens without relogging into the server etc.
  
  Example:
  
  cavanaug@lajolla ~ 1%  svn
  
  svn> status foo.c
  
    output of command
  
  svn> commit bar.h
  
    output of command
  
  svn> cd subdir
  svn> status README
  
    output of command
  
  svn> quit
  
  cavanaug@lajolla ~ 2%  svn
  
  Personally I think this is a really convenient way to operate
  interactively on a directory without having to continually re-run the
  svn client.
  
  Plus this is method is a godsend if you want to write scripts that
  automate svn. (ie. Perhaps like the cvs2svn or xxx2svn)

** Possible implementation information

   From: Dave Glowacki <dglo@ssec.wisc.edu>
   
   <snip>
   
   There's 'getline', which doesn't have all of readline's features,
   but which does basic editing.  ncftp and tin can be built with
   getline instead of readline, so it does a decent enough job.
   
   You can find it at ftp://ftp.sco.com/skunkware/src/lib/getline-39-src.tar.gz

* possible cvs-compatibility wrapper for svn

  ... no matter how the command line interface for SVN ends up like, it
  would still be cool to offer a 'stealth-mode' SVN client that would
  look and feel exactly (well, as similar as it can) like a cvs
  client...
  
  
  "Jonathan S. Shapiro" <shap@eros-os.org> replied: 
  
  Wouldn't Perl be good for this?
  Why crud up the new system with compatibility code?
  
  
  Dave Glowacki <dglo@ssec.wisc.edu> further opined:
  
  I agree, and I also support Jonathan Shapiro's idea that a
  cvs-compatibility wrapper could be written in Perl and would simply
  map the CVS options to the Subversion options (and maybe echo the
  proper 'svn' options back so that it'd serve as a learning tool as
  well.)
  
  That way, Subversion can have its own options (-r instead of -R)
  and not have to worry about the CVS cruft like '-d' meaning one
  thing as a global option and another thing as a command option.

* need to add "hooks" for updating and committing
  
  Currently, the `svn' binary calls routines in libsvn_client that
hide all internal activity.  For example, if the client calls
svn_client_update(), how can it print out all the cute little symbols
like CVS does?

       U foo.c
       U bar.c
       P baz.c
       C glorb.c

  We need to allow "hook" routines that will be automatically called
when driving an editor.

  Here's a neat, possible way to do it: write a new editor
implementation which is nothing more than a wrapper for a *real*
editor.

  Simply define editor->foo() to be

     {
       foo_hook();
       real_editor->foo();
     }



* split libsvn_WC into two components

  split into: one for managing the metadata (the stuff in ./SVN/), and one
  for the rest of the WC functionality (crawling and updating). This would
  provide a way to use multiple metadata storage and management options,
  possibly optimized for the platform at hand.

  Alternate storage options: separate file streams (NTFS streams, MacOS
  resource forks), a single database of data (rather than per-dir), or
  server-based storage (via DeltaV)
