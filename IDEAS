   Oh Most High and Puissant Emacs, please be in -*- outline -*- mode!

Some ideas for the future.
(Please use outline-mode format for this file.)

* todo: move the ideas in doc/future.texi to here

  Because plaintext/outline is less of a barrier to adding new ideas
  than texinfo format; this should be a pretty informal file.

* shell-like interactive mode for client (like ftp)

  I know people are beginning to work on the command line client, so I
  hope Im not too late with this request.
  
  Basically I would like svn to behave like ftp (actually more like lftp
  or ncftp).
  
  What this means is that if you type just "svn<return>" you get dropped
  into an interactive svn shell where you can type a litany of commands.
  Preferably this happens without relogging into the server etc.
  
  Example:
  
  cavanaug@lajolla ~ 1%  svn
  
  svn> status foo.c
  
    output of command
  
  svn> commit bar.h
  
    output of command
  
  svn> cd subdir
  svn> status README
  
    output of command
  
  svn> quit
  
  cavanaug@lajolla ~ 2%  svn
  
  Personally I think this is a really convenient way to operate
  interactively on a directory without having to continually re-run the
  svn client.
  
  Plus this is method is a godsend if you want to write scripts that
  automate svn. (ie. Perhaps like the cvs2svn or xxx2svn)
