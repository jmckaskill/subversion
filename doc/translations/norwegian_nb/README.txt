This is the Norwegian Bokm√•l translation of the Subversion Book. Its 
main repository is located at

  http://svn.sunbase.org/repos/svnbook_nb

This is where the actual stuff happens, and the files are copied from 
there to the Subversion repository when they reach something close to a 
presentable state.

The overall status of the translation is described in the file
  http://svn.sunbase.org/repos/svnbook_nb/trunk/TRANSLATION-STATUS
which is continuously updated.

If you want to join the translation, please send a mail to 
<dev@subversion.tigris.org> .
