This is a -*- text -*- file.


--------------------------------------------------------------

To be fixed by someone:

  - When using shared working copies, a user changing the permissions
    of a file directly (svn ps svn:executable) or indirectly
    (i.e. through an update), must own that file.  There is no way to
    do this automatically which does not involve possible data loss.

--------------------------------------------------------------

Put in best-practices doc:

  - (perhaps) suggest the use of environment variables to represent
    long repository URLs.  useful for lots of branching/tagging commands.
    Maybe this can go into our existing best-practices doc?


--------------------------------------------------------------

To be added by someone:

  - With svn 1.1, it's now possible to set up svn+ssh using just one
    Unix account on the server.  The book should perhaps document this
    way of setting up svn+ssh.  See notes/ssh-tricks for details.

  - ch06 talks about Basic authentication and recommends https.
    Add a mention of Digest authentication now that Apache's bug
    has been fixed that broke it and potentially update the 
    example to use it instead.

--------------------------------------------------------------
To be fixed by someone:

 - we seem to inconsistently assume repositories live either in
   /usr/local/svn/ or /usr/local/repositories/ throughout the book.
   We ought to consistify.

To be fixed by sussman:

ch04:

   - need a giant warning-box about how our lack of 'true renames' can
     be really irritating when doing merges.  The classic case is when
     branchA moves things around, and branch B just changes file text.
     When you merge branchA into branchB, you deleting the newer file
     versions and adding-with-history the older file versions.
     Definitely a big 'gotcha' to watch out for.

   - 'mixed tag' section.  explain how 'svn cp URL' works, that it's
     not just a literal 'cp -R' to the repository.  mixed-rev
     directories can create a repos tree different than you expect.
     the mixed-tag example assumes you start with a WC all at one
     revision, then only back/fore-date *files*, not dirs.

   - document merge conflicts:  fulltexts are named {.working, .left,
     .right}, which is confusingly just-slightly-different from the
     fulltext files produced by 'svn up' conflicts:  {.mine, .rX, .rY}.


ch06:  

   - in server comparison table, add a footnote to svnserve
     authorization cell: note that per-directory *write* access can
     still be done by a hook script (but not read access).

List of 1.1 features/changes (that still need to be documented)
============================

  * Need whole new section to explain "peg objects" and history
    tracing.  Lots of examples involving different subcommands.
    (Which chapter should this section go in?)

  * Need whole new section explaining activating l10n and IRI autoescaping.
    (What chapter should this section go in?)

  * New 'SVNPathAuthz Off' directive, to disable path-based authz in
    apache (and increase speed.)


List of 1.2 features/changes (that still need to be documented)
============================

  * svn log --limit
  * Fixed length keywords
    The format of fixed length keyword and its data is
    - Unexpanded keyword:         "$keyword::       $"
    - Expanded keyword:           "$keyword:: value $"
    - Expanded kw with filling:   "$keyword:: value   $"
    - Truncated keyword:          "$keyword:: longval#$"
