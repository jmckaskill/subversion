SVN for former CVS Users
=========================

This document is meant to be a quick-start guide for CVS users new to
Subversion.  It's not a substitute for real documentation and manuals;
but it should give you a quick conceptual 'diff' when switching over.


* Revision numbers mean something different now.

* Distinction between 'status' and 'update'

    - CVS has unreadable status output
    - CVS shows status info while updating
    - SVN unmuddles the two issues (explain)
    - describe status output format, and switches

* Reversion and Diffs

    - SVN secretly keeps pristine copies of files
    - To toss local mods, or to undo the results of an 'svn add' or
      'svn remove' command,  'svn revert' works offline, and is
      preferable to the CVS habit of 'rm foo; svn up'
    - 'svn diff' works offline too

* Directory versioning

    - tree structures are versioned;  no more RCS backend.
    - svn add, remove works on dirs
    - working revnums on dirs *only* increment on updates, else we're lying
    - dirprops only committable on up-to-date dirs

* Conflicts

    - explain '.rej' system as alternative to in-code conflict markers
    - To toss your version of foo:  'rm foo.rej;  svn revert foo'

* Properties

    - svn propset, propget, proplist
    - properties are versioned too:  '.prej' files in conflicts
    - examples of using -F switch
    - describe common props:
        svn:ignore, svn:mime-type, ...

* Binariness

    - implemented as a property
    - auto-detected by 'svn add' and 'svn import', no need for -kb
    - can be hand-modified using propset
    - no merging on binary files -- two files appear side-by-side.
    - line conversions and keyword expansions are suspended

* Branches and Tags

    - they don't exist, only 'cheap' subdir copies. 

* any other things that may shock or confuse a CVS user?
