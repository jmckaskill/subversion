This style guide is intended to be *in addition* to the O'Reilly and
Associates style guide at
http://www.ora.com/oreilly/author/stylesheet.html
===========================================================================

===========
Prose Guide
===========

Tone: somewhere between formal and informal. 
      For example:
      - We use contractions
      - We don't say things like "You see"

- Always title sidebars  

- High level chapter outline: 
  - This is what I'm going to tell you.
  - I'm telling you this *right now*.
  - This is what I told you.

- We have a "Version Control System", NOT a "Revision Control
  System"

- We have "working copies", not "working directories"

- Always use long Subversion commands (e.g. checkout, not co, etc)

- Always "Apache HTTP Server" not httpd.

Subversion Guide

- Our sample repository will be its own repository that all
  examples come from and it will be publically accessible. ###TODO

- Primary user: Sally

Markup Guide
============

- The DTD used for the Subversion book is the Docbook Lite DTD as
  defined by O'Reilly & Associates. You'll find it at in our source
  tree and in ftp://ftp.oreilly.com/pub/dblite/

- You should *always* validate your xml before checking in. Do not
  check in xml that is not well-formed.

- All markup should be properly indented, with the exception of
  <screen></screen> blocks, which should be aligned all the way to the
  left. For example:

<chapter id="svn-ch-pi">
<title>Tips</title>

  <!-- ================================================================= -->
  <!-- ======================== SECTION 1 ============================== -->
  <!-- ================================================================= -->
  <sect1 id="svn-ch-pi-sect-1">
    <title>Flornthorple Plathering</title>
    
    <para>The real key to <firstterm>Plathering</firstterm> is to start with
       a good glab. A good glab provides a solid thorpy foundation.</para>

    <sect2 id="svn-ch-pi-sect-1.1">
      <title>Cross-blather</title>
      
      <para>Cross-blather tends to create a hoopy pile of crandy. You
        can avoid this by using the cross-blather avoid
        command.</para>

      <screen>
$ cb-avoid
Avoiding blather......... Done
$
      </screen>
              
    </sect2>

  </sect1>

</chapter>

Miscellaneous
=============

- Anything that needs attention or fixing should be marked with
  ###TODO so that it's easy to find. Also, please add your userid to
  any inline comments to facilitate discussion 'in the code.'
