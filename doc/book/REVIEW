Review and comments on the Subversion book listed by chapter.

Chapter 5

    Section svn-ch-5-sect-2.1

            There is this paragraph

            <para>Currently there are five true hooks implemented by the
            Subversion repository:</para>

            My question is, what makes a hook considered a "true" hook?

            I think this section on svnlook tree requires more
            explanation of what is being printed, what is a node
            revision ID, etc.  It makes statements on how it can be
            helpful to administrators but doesn't say how.  It also
            doesn't say how to decide if a dead transaction is really
            dead.  I suggest either removing it entirely, increasing
            the description substantially, or least preferably, just
            linking to an external document that explains this in
            greater detail, but that's not really appropriate for a
            book, it it then :)

            I don't know if the "Adding Projects" sections works best
            here.  It follows pretty specific information on setting
            up a repository, debugging, recovering, which are highly
            specific and not generally used.  This section could be
            missed.  This information is also used by people who
            aren't Subversion "administrator's".  For example, at my
            work, there are people creating new projects pretty
            consistently and we have 61 projects.  While I'm the
            administrator, the users and programmers also need to know
            project layout information.

            There's a repository layout section in chapter 4 that this
            could well be merged into.  If that doesn't work, I would
            consider moving it up to the front of this chapter.

Chapter 6

    Section svn-ch-6-sect-4

        #1) Blair

            In this sentence:

                The result is a standardized,
                robust system that is conveniently packaged as part of the
                Apache 2.0 software, is supported by numerous pieces of core
                operating system and third-party products, and which doesn't
                require network administrators to open up yet another custom
                port.

            What does this mean "is supported by numerous pieces of
            core operating system ... products"?  It would seem that
            Apache supports running on these OSes.

            Maybe changing it to read "is supported by numerous
            operating systems and third-party products, and which ..." 
            makes more sense.
