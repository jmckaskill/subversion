This is a -*- text -*- file.


--------------------------------------------------------------

To be fixed by someone:

  - When using shared working copies, a user changing the permissions
    of a file directly (svn ps svn:executable) or indirectly
    (i.e. through an update), must own that file.  There is no way to
    do this automatically which does not involve possible data loss.

--------------------------------------------------------------

Put in best-practices doc:

  - (perhaps) suggest the use of environment variables to represent
    long repository URLs.  useful for lots of branching/tagging commands.
    Maybe this can go into our existing best-practices doc?


--------------------------------------------------------------
To be fixed by someone:

 - we seem to inconsistently assume repositories live either in
   /usr/local/svn/ or /usr/local/repositories/ throughout the book.
   We ought to consistify.

To be fixed by sussman:

ch04:

   - 'mixed tag' section.  explain how 'svn cp URL' works, that it's
     not just a literal 'cp -R' to the repository.  mixed-rev
     directories can create a repos tree different than you expect.
     the mixed-tag example assumes you start with a WC all at one
     revision, then only back/fore-date *files*, not dirs.

List of 1.1 features/changes (that still need to be documented)
============================

  * Need whole new section to explain "peg objects" and history
    tracing.  Lots of examples involving different subcommands.
    (Which chapter should this section go in?)

  * Need whole new section explaining activating l10n and IRI autoescaping.
    (What chapter should this section go in?)

  * New 'SVNPathAuthz Off' directive, to disable path-based authz in
    apache (and increase speed.)
