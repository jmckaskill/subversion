This is a -*- text -*- file.


--------------------------------------------------------------

Put in best-practices doc:

  - (perhaps) suggest the use of environment variables to represent
    long repository URLs.  useful for lots of branching/tagging commands.
    Maybe this can go into our existing best-practices doc?


--------------------------------------------------------------
To be fixed by someone:

 - we seem to inconstisently assume repositories live either in
   /usr/local/svn/ or /usr/local/repositories/ throughout the book.
   We ought to consistify.

ch09:

  - svnserve isn't mentioned at *all*.  this is really inconsistent;
    it's used at least as much as 'svnlook' or other binaries we
    ship.  it's not a 2nd-class citizen;  it needs to be documented in
    the reference chapter like everything else.  (run 'man svnserve'
    and/or read chapter 6 to understand how it works)
