This is a -*- text -*- file.


--------------------------------------------------------------

Put in best-practices doc:

  - (perhaps) suggest the use of environment variables to represent
    long repository URLs.  useful for lots of branching/tagging commands.
    Maybe this can go into our existing best-practices doc?


--------------------------------------------------------------
To be fixed by someone:

 - people are screaming for a 1-page 'quickstart' to exist somewhere.
   not everyone has patience to read the entire book, get a top-down
   understanding of everything, and then start experimenting.  Ben
   tried to satisfy the bottom-up learners by writing the 1-page
   Quickstart in our README file.  But Karl and Ben and others think
   it should be put in the book *somewhere*:  in Appendix A?  Maybe at
   the very end of chapter 1?  Thoughts?

 - we seem to inconstisently assume repositories live either in
   /usr/local/svn/ or /usr/local/repositories/ throughout the book.
   We ought to consistify.

ch05: 

  - from Tatiana: "we need some text between the two headings on page
    79: Repository Maintenance and an Administrator's Toolkit"

--------------------------------------------------------------

To be fixed by fitz:

ch03:

  - bizarre grammar: "Let's say that, due to a miscommunication
        between you and your collaborator, Sally, both edit the file
        _sandwich.txt_ at the same time."


  - Be clear that PREV, BASE, and COMMITTED only refer to local paths,
    not to URLs.

  - import section at the end:

   - you use the word 'above' which is verboten, right?
  
   - explain that while 'svn import' creates intermediate directories
     for you, 'svn mkdir', 'svn move', and 'svn copy' will not. 

   - generally, need more examples so users understand when new
     directories will be created, and when they won't.  users are
     constantly confused by this.
  
   - create a 'tip' sidebar (?) in the 'svn import' section which
     explains how to do an "in place" import; we have a FAQ on this
     already.  people keep asking about it.


ch09:

  - svnserve isn't mentioned at *all*.  this is really inconsistent;
    it's used at least as much as 'svnlook' or other binaries we
    ship.  it's not a 2nd-class citizen;  it needs to be documented in
    the reference chapter like everything else.  (run 'man svnserve'
    and/or read chapter 6 to understand how it works)

  - Document svnadmin --deltify.  (yes, it's vestigial, but people
    keep asking it what it is.  be sure to explain what
    "deltification" is, and/or point to an existing description.)

To be fixed by sussman:

ch01:

  - add short quickstart section from README??

ch02:

  - "After completing a commit to the repository, the freshly
     committed files and directories are _AT A_ more recent working
     revision than the rest of the working copy.

ch04:

   - explain what it means for 'diff' and 'merge' to ignore or pay
     attention to ancestry.

   - document 'svn log -v --stop-on-copy branchURL' as the easiest way to
     discover when a branch was created.  This is a major FAQ.

   - repeated merges:  we shouldn't do repeat merge of 406:HEAD, but
     rather 405:some-specific-HEAD number.  we need to know the head
     number so we can write a good log message.

   - from tatiana: seems to be an extra space in code on page
     63. "Transmitting file data [extra space]."

ch06:

   - in Body text, Sally and Harry are in lowercase.  Correct these
     throughout where they appear in the paragraphs?

appA:

   - be fair when we criticize 'cvs up';  many users run 'cvs up -n'
     to preview local mods rather than just 'cvs up'.
