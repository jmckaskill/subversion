This is a -*- text -*- file.


--------------------------------------------------------------

To be fixed by someone:

  - When using shared working copies, a user changing the permissions
    of a file directly (svn ps svn:executable) or indirectly
    (i.e. through an update), must own that file.  There is no way to
    do this automatically which does not involve possible data loss.

--------------------------------------------------------------

Put in best-practices doc:

  - (perhaps) suggest the use of environment variables to represent
    long repository URLs.  useful for lots of branching/tagging commands.
    Maybe this can go into our existing best-practices doc?


--------------------------------------------------------------
To be fixed by someone:

 - we seem to inconsistently assume repositories live either in
   /usr/local/svn/ or /usr/local/repositories/ throughout the book.
   We ought to consistify.

To be fixed by sussman:

ch04:

   - 'mixed tag' section.  explain how 'svn cp URL' works, that it's
     not just a literal 'cp -R' to the repository.  mixed-rev
     directories can create a repos tree different than you expect.
     the mixed-tag example assumes you start with a WC all at one
     revision, then only back/fore-date *files*, not dirs.

List of 1.1 features/changes
============================

  * www/svn_1.1_relasenotes.html really needs to be converted into a
    new section in the book's preface, complete with <xref> links to
    the new 1.1 features.

  * FSFS TODO:  update 'svnadmin create' in reference section.
                expand Omnigraffle picture.
                scan other chapters for BDB-specific stuff.

  * symlink versioning

  * slightly tweaked 'svn diff' syntax allows things like
    'svn diff -rX:Y URL@Z'.   Probably need to explain 'peg' objects,
    so folks can understand how/when renames are followed by certain
    commands.

       --> really, we need a whole new section full of examples that
           demonstrate syntaxes that follow history, vs. those that
           don't.

  * do we need to tell people how to activate localized client
    output?  or is that just widespread knowledge?

  * remove SVN_REVNUM_T_FMT from any example code.

  * document new 'svnadmin dump --deltas' in ch05 and ch09.

  * svn export --native-eol

  * In the section on "Supporting Multiple Repository Access Methods",
    the chmod g+s command is no longer necessary for repositories
    created with svn 1.1, since we take care of that now.

  * document svn:special property, and how symlinks can be put under
    version control.   and what (doesn't) happen on win32.

  * Add a note somewhere clarifying that the command line client auto-escapes
    URIs and supports "IRI" syntax.

  * New $Revision$ alias

  * New non-blocking 'svnadmin recover' lock behavior, with --wait option

  * New 'SVNPathAuthz Off' directive
