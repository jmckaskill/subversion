    <title>What is Subversion?</title>
      
    <para>Subversion is a free/open-source <firstterm>version control
        system</firstterm>.  That is, Subversion manages files over
      time.  The files are placed into a central
      <firstterm>repository</firstterm>.  The repository is much
      like an ordinary file server, except that it remembers every
      change ever made to your files.  This allows you to recover
      older versions of your files, or browse the history of how
      your files changed.  Many people think of a version control
      system as a sort of ``time machine.''</para>
    
    <para>Some version control systems are also <firstterm>software
        configuration management</firstterm> (SCM) systems.  These
      systems are specifically tailored to manage trees of source
      code, and have many features that are specific to software
      development (such as natively understanding programming
      languages).  Subversion, however, is not one of these
      systems; it is a general system that can be used to manage
      <emphasis>any</emphasis> sort of collection of files,
      including source code.</para>

    <title>Subversion's History</title>

    <para>Where did Subversion come from?</para>
    
    <para>Subversion aims to be the successor to the
      <firstterm>Concurrent Versions System</firstterm> (CVS). You
      can find more information about CVS at <systemitem
        class="url">http://www.cvshome.org/</systemitem>.</para>
    
    <para>At the time of writing, CVS is the standard Free version
      control system used by the open-source community.  It has a
      hard-earned, well-deserved reputation as stable and useful
      software, and has a design that makes it perfect for
      open-source development.  However, it also has a number of
      problems that are difficult to fix.</para>
    
    <para>Subversion's original designers settled on a few simple
      goals.  First, it was decided that Subversion should be a
      functional replacement for CVS.  That is, it should do
      everything that CVS does, preserving the same development
      model while fixing the most obvious flaws.  Secondly, with
      existing CVS users as the first target audience, Subversion
      should be written such that any CVS user should be able to
      start using it with little effort.</para>
    
    <para>Collabnet <systemitem
        class="url">http://www.collab.net/</systemitem> provided the
      initial funding in 2000 to begin development work, and the
      effort has now blossomed into a large, open-source project
      backed by a community of free software developers.</para>

    <title>Subversion's Features</title>

    <para>What sort of things does Subversion do better than CVS?
      Here's a short list to whet your appetite:</para>

    <variablelist>

      <varlistentry>
        <term>Advanced network layer</term>
        <listitem>
          <para>The Subversion network server is Apache, and client
            and server speak WebDAV protocol to one another.  ###TODO
            Xref to Designe
          </para>
        </listitem>
      </varlistentry>

      <varlistentry>
        <term>Faster network access</term>
        <listitem>
          <para>A binary diffing algorithm is used to store
            and transmit deltas in both directions, regardless of whether a file
            is of text or binary type.</para>
        </listitem>
      </varlistentry>

      <varlistentry>
        <term>Meta-data</term>
        <listitem>
          <para>Each file or directory has an invisible hash table
            attached.  You can invent and store any arbitrary key/value pairs you
            wish: owner, perms, icons, app-creator, mime-type, personal notes,
            etc.  This is a general-purpose feature for users.  Properties are
            versioned over time, just like file contents.</para>
        </listitem>
      </varlistentry>
      
      <varlistentry>
        <term>Hackability</term>
        <listitem>
          <para>Subversion has no historical baggage; it is primarily
            a collection of shared C libraries with well-defined APIs.  This makes
            Subversion extremely maintainable and usable by other applications and
            languages.</para>
        </listitem>
      </varlistentry>

      <varlistentry>
        <term>Directory versioning</term>
        <listitem>
          <para>The Subversion repository doesn't use RCS files like
            CVS; instead, it implements a <quote>virtual</quote>
            versioned filesystem that tracks changes to directory/file
            heirarchies over time.  Files <emphasis>and</emphasis>
            directories are versioned.  At last, there are real
            client-side <command>move</command> and
            <command>copy</command> commands.</para>
        </listitem>
      </varlistentry>

      <varlistentry>
        <term>Atomic commits</term>
        <listitem>
          <para>A commit either goes into the repository
            completely, or not all.</para>
        </listitem>
