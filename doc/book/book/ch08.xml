  <title>Subversion Complete Reference</title>
  
  <simplesect>
    <para>This chapter is intended to be a complete reference to using
      Subversion. This includes the command line client
      (<command>svn</command>) and all its commands, repository
      administration programs (<command>svnadmin</command> and
      <command>svnlook</command>) and their respective commands,
      repository configuration files, commit hooks, client
      configuration files, and working copy administrative areas.

    <title>The Subversion Command Line Client:
      <command>svn</command></title>
    
    <para>To use the command line client, you type
      <command>svn</command>, the subcommand you wish to use,
      <footnote><para>Yes, yes, you don't need a subcommand to use the
      <option>--version</option> switch, but we'll get to that in just
      a minute.</para> </footnote> and any switches or targets that
      you wish to operate on.  You should note that there is no
      specific order that the subcommand and the switches must appear
      in (the targets, however, are always last in the command line).
      For example, all of the following are valid ways to use
      <command>svn status</command>:</para>

    <screen>
$ svn -v status
$ svn status -v 
$ svn status -v myfile
    </screen>

    <para>You can find many more examples of how to use most client
      commands, in <xref linkend="svn-ch-3"/>, commands for managing
      properties in <xref linkend="svn-ch-6-sect-2"/></para>

      <title>Switches</title> 
      
      <para>While Subversion has different switches for its
        subcommands, all switches are global&mdash;that is, each
        switch is guaranteed to mean the same thing regardless of
        the subcommand you use it with.  For example,
        <option>--verbose</option> (<option>-v</option>) always
        means <quote>verbose output</quote>, regardless of the
        subcommand you use it with.</para>

              that Subversion will display unified diffs by default,

            <para>Prints output in a format suitable for

              beginning of a log message, after each subsequent log
              message, and following the final log message.  If you
              ran svn log on a range of two revisions, you would get
              this:</para>
<!-- ###TODO move this to svn log's section. -->
            <screen>
$ svn log -r 14:15
------------------------------------------------------------------------
rev 14: ...

------------------------------------------------------------------------
rev 15: ...

------------------------------------------------------------------------
            </screen>

            <para>However, if you wanted to gather 2 non-sequential
              log messages into a file, you might do something like
              this:</para>

            <screen>
$ svn log -r 14 > mylog
$ svn log -r 19 >> mylog
$ svn log -r 27 >> mylog
$ cat mylog
------------------------------------------------------------------------

------------------------------------------------------------------------
rev 19: ...

------------------------------------------------------------------------
------------------------------------------------------------------------
rev 27: ...

------------------------------------------------------------------------
            </screen>

            <para>Note the double dashed lines that you get in your
            output. You can avoid this clutter by using the
            incremental switch:</para>


            <screen>
$ svn log --incremental -r 14 > mylog
$ svn log --incremental -r 19 >> mylog
$ svn log --incremental -r 27 >> mylog
$ cat mylog

rev 14: ...

------------------------------------------------------------------------
rev 19: ...

------------------------------------------------------------------------
rev 27: ...
              </screen>

            <para>Note that the incremental switch does provides
              similar output control when using the
              <option>--xml</option> switch.</para>

The goal is to coordinate it and add examples for every subcommmand.

###TODO Stopped at svn merge
  
============================================================
svn add

svn add PATH [PATH [PATH ... ]]

Adds files and directories to your working copy and schedules them for
addition to the repository.  They will be uploaded and added to the
repository on your next commit.  If you add something and change your
mind before committing, you can unschedule the addition using
<command>svn revert</command>.


Alternate names: None
Changes: Working Copy
Needs Network: No
Switches:
--targets FILENAME
--non-recursive (-N)
--quiet (-q)

Examples

To add a file to your working copy:

$ svn add foo.c 
A         foo.c

When adding a directory, the default behavior of svn add is to recurse:

$ svn add testdir
A         testdir
A         testdir/a
A         testdir/b
A         testdir/c
A         testdir/d

You can add a directory without adding its contents:

$ svn add --non-recursive otherdir
A         otherdir

============================================================
svn cat

svn cat TARGET [TARGET [TARGET ... ]]

Outputs the contents of the specified files or URLs.  For listing the
contents of directories, see svn ls

Alternate names: None
Changes: Nothing
Needs Network: Yes
Switches:
--revision (-r) REV
--username USER
--password PASS

Examples

If you want to view readme.txt in your repository without checking it out:

$ svn cat http://svn.red-bean.com/repos/test/readme.txt
This is a README file.
You should read this.

============================================================

svn checkout

svn checkout URL [URL [URL ... ]] [PATH]

Checks out a working copy from a repository. If
<replaceable>PATH</replaceable> is omitted, the basename of the URL
will be used as the destination. If multiple URLs are given each will
be checked out into a sub-directory of PATH, with the name of the
sub-directory being the basename of the URL.

Alternate names: co
Changes: Creates a working copy.
Needs Network:
Switches:
--revision (-r) REV
--quiet (-q)
--non-recursive (-N)
--username USER
--password PASS
--no-auth-cache
--non-interactive

Examples

Check out a working copy into a directory called 'mine':

$ svn checkout file:///tmp/repos/test mine
A  mine/a
A  mine/b
Checked out revision 2.
$ ls
mine

Check out 2 different directories into two separate working copies:

$ svn checkout file:///tmp/repos/test  file:///tmp/repos/quiz
A  test/a
A  test/b
Checked out revision 2.
A  quiz/l
A  quiz/m
Checked out revision 2.
$ ls
quiz  test

Check out 2 different directories into two separate working copies,
but place both into a directory called 'working copies':

$ svn checkout file:///tmp/repos/test  file:///tmp/repos/quiz working-copies
A  working-copies/test/a
A  working-copies/test/b
Checked out revision 2.
A  working-copies/quiz/l
A  working-copies/quiz/m
Checked out revision 2.
$ ls
working-copies

============================================================

svn cleanup

svn cleanup [PATH [PATH ... ]]

Recursively clean up the working copy, removing locks resuming
unfinished operations.  If you ever get a <quote>working copy
locked</quote> error, run this command to remove stale locks and get
your working copy into a useable state again.

Alternate names: None
Changes: Working copy
Needs Network: No
Switches: None

Examples

Well, there's not much to the examples here as svn cleanup generates
no output.  If you pass no PATH, '.' is used.

$ svn cleanup

$ svn cleanup /path/to/working-copy

============================================================

svn commit

svn commit [PATH [PATH ... ]]

Be sure to use one of -m or -F to send a log message.

Alternate names: ci
Changes: working copy, repository
Needs Network: Yes
Switches:
--message (-m) TEXT
--file (-F) FILE
--quiet (-q)
--non-recursive (-N)
--targets FILENAME
--force
--username USER
--password PASS
--no-auth-cache
--non-interactive
--encoding ENC

Examples

Commit a simple modification to a file with the commit message on the cmdline:

$ svn commit -m "added howto section."
Sending        a
Transmitting file data .
Committed revision 3.

Commit a modification to a file with the commit message in a file:

$ svn commit -F msg foo.c
Sending        foo.c
Transmitting file data .
Committed revision 5.

Note that if you want to use a files that's under version control for
your commit message with -F, you need to pass the --force switch:

$ svn commit -F file_under_vc.txt foo.c
Sending        foo.c
Transmitting file data .
Committed revision 6.

Commit a deleted a file:

svn commit -m "removed file 'c'."
Deleting       c

Committed revision 7.



============================================================
svn copy

svn copy SRC DST

SRC and DST can each be either a working copy (WC) path or URL:
WC  -&gt; WC:   copy and schedule for addition (with history)
WC  -&gt; URL:  immediately commit a copy of WC to URL
URL -&gt; WC:   check out URL into WC, schedule for addition
URL -&gt; URL:  complete server-side copy;  used to branch &amp; tag


Alternate names: cp
Changes: Repository, and working copy if operating on files 
Needs Network: Yes
Switches:
--message (-m) TEXT
--file (-F) FILE
--revision (-r) REV
--quiet (-q)
--username USER
--password PASS
--no-auth-cache
--non-interactive
--encoding ENC

Examples

Copy an item within your working copy (Just schedules the
copy--nothing goes into the repository until you commit):

$ svn cp a b
$

Copy an item in your working copy to a URL in the repository (an
immediate commit, so you must supply a commit message):

$ svn cp a file:///tmp/repos/test/far-away -m "Remote copy."

Committed revision 8.

Copy an item from the repository to your working copy (Just schedules
the copy--nothing goes into the repository until you commit):

$ svn cp file:///tmp/repos/test/far-away near-here
A         near-here

And finally, copying between two URLs:

$ svn cp file:///tmp/repos/test/far-away file:///tmp/repos/test/over-there -m "remote copy."

Committed revision 9.

(Note: This is the easiest way to 'tag' a revision in your
repository--just svn copy that revision (usually HEAD) into your tags
directory).  

$ svn cp file:///tmp/repos/test/trunk file:///tmp/repos/test/tags/0.6.32-prerelease -m "tag tree"

Committed revision 12.

And don't worry if you forgot to tag--you can always specify an older revision and tag anytime:

$ svn cp -r 11 file:///tmp/repos/test/trunk file:///tmp/repos/test/tags/0.6.32-prerelease -m "Forgot to tag at rev 11"

Committed revision 13.

============================================================

svn delete 

svn delete [TARGET [TARGET ... ]]

If run on a working copy TARGET, the item is scheduled for deletion
upon the next commit.  Files, and directories that have not been
committed, are immediately removed from the working copy.  The command
will not remove TARGETs that are, or contain, unversioned or modified
items; use the --force option to override this behaviour.

If run on an URL, the item is deleted from the repository via an
immediate commit.

Alternate names: del, remove, rm
Changes: Working copy if operating on files, Repository if operating on URLs
Needs Network: Only if operating on URLs
Switches:
--force
--message (-m) TEXT
--file (-F) FILE
--quiet (-q)
--targets FILENAME
--username USER
--password PASS
--no-auth-cache
--non-interactive
--encoding ENC

Examples

Deleting a file from your working copy merely schedules it for
deletion. When you commit, the file is deleted in the repository.

$ svn delete myfile
D         d

$ svn ci -m "Deleted file 'myfile'."
Deleting       myfile
Transmitting file data .
Committed revision 14.

Deleting a URL, however, is immediate, so you have to supply a log message:

# svn delete -m "Deleting file 'yourfile'" file:///tmp/repos/test/yourfile

Committed revision 15.

Here's an example of how to force delete a file that has local mods:

$ svn delete over-there 
subversion/clients/cmdline/delete-cmd.c:47: (apr_err=195006)
svn: Attempting restricted operation for modified resource
svn: Use --force to override this restriction
subversion/libsvn_client/delete.c:90: (apr_err=195006)
svn: 'over-there' has local modifications

$ svn delete --force over-there 
D         over-there

============================================================

svn diff

svn diff [-r N[:M]] [TARGET [TARGET ... ]]
svn diff URL1[@N] URL2[@M]

1. Each TARGET can be either a working copy path or URL.  If no
   TARGET is specified, a value of '.' is assumed.

   If TARGET is a URL, then revs N and M must be given via -r.

   If TARGET is a working copy path, then -r switch means:
     -r N:M  : server compares TARGET@N and TARGET@M,
     -r N    : client compares TARGET@N against working copy
     (no -r) : client compares base and working copies of TARGET

2. If the alternate syntax is used, the server compares URL1 and URL2
   at revisions N and M respectively.  If either N or M are ommitted,
   a value of HEAD is assumed.


Alternate names: di
Changes: Nothing
Needs Network: For diffs against anything but BASE revision in your working copy
Switches:
--revision (-r) REV
--extensions (-x) "ARGS"
--non-recursive (-N)
--username USER
--password PASS
--no-auth-cache
--non-interactive
--no-diff-deleted

Examples


   If TARGET is a working copy path, then -r switch means:
     -r N:M  : server compares TARGET@N and TARGET@M,
     -r N    : client compares TARGET@N against working copy
     (no -r) : client compares base and working copies of TARGET


Compare BASE and your working copy (One of the most popular uses of
svn diff):

$ svn diff COMMITTERS 
Index: COMMITTERS
===================================================================
--- COMMITTERS	(revision 4404)
+++ COMMITTERS	(working copy)

See how your working copy's modifications compare against an older revision:

$ svn diff -r 3900 COMMITTERS 
Index: COMMITTERS
===================================================================
--- COMMITTERS	(revision 3900)
+++ COMMITTERS	(working copy)

Compare revision 3000 to revision 3500 using '@' syntax:

$ svn diff http://svn.collab.net/repos/svn/trunk/COMMITTERS@3000 http://svn.collab.net/repos/svn/trunk/COMMITTERS@3500
Index: COMMITTERS
===================================================================
--- COMMITTERS	(revision 3000)
+++ COMMITTERS	(revision 3500)
...

Compare revision 3000 to revision 3500 using range notation (note that
you only pass the one URL in this case):

$ svn diff -r 3000:3500 http://svn.collab.net/repos/svn/trunk/COMMITTERS
Index: COMMITTERS
===================================================================
--- COMMITTERS	(revision 3000)
+++ COMMITTERS	(revision 3500)

If you have a working copy, you can do the diffs without typing in the long URLs:

$ svn diff -r 3000:3500 COMMITTERS 
Index: COMMITTERS
===================================================================
--- COMMITTERS	(revision 3000)
+++ COMMITTERS	(revision 3500)

Use -x to pass arguments directly to the external diff program

svn diff -x "-i -b" COMMITTERS

svn export

svn export [-r REV] URL [PATH]
svn export PATH1 PATH2

The first exports a clean directory tree from the repository specified by
URL, at revision REV if it is given, otherwise at HEAD, into 
PATH. If PATH is omitted, the last component of the URL is used
for the local directory name.

The second exports a clean directory tree from the working copy
specified by PATH1 into PATH2.  all local changes will be preserved,
but files not under revision control will not be copied.

Alternate names: None
Changes: local disk
Needs Network: Only if exporting from a URL
Switches:
--revision (-r) REV
--quiet (-q)
--username USER
--password PASS
--no-auth-cache
--non-interactive

Examples

Export from your working copy (doesn't print every file/dir):

$ svn export a-wc my-export
pantheon: /tmp&gt;

Export directly from the repository (prints every file/dir):

$ svn export file:///tmp/repos my-export
A  my-export/test
A  my-export/quiz

============================================================

svn import

svn import URL [PATH] [NEW_ENTRY_IN_REPOS]

Recursively commit a copy of PATH to URL.  If no 3rd arg, copy
top-level contents of PATH into URL directly.  Otherwise, create
NEW_ENTRY underneath URL and begin copy there.

Alternate names: None
Changes: Repository
Needs Network: Yes
Switches:
--message (-m) TEXT
--file (-F) FILE
--quiet (-q)

$ svn import -m "New import" http://svn.red-bean.com/repos/test myproj
Adding         myproj/sample.txt
...
Transmitting file data .........
Committed revision 16.

Import local directory 'myproj' into 'trunk/vendors' in your
repository.  Note that the directory 'trunk/vendors' must exist before
you import into it--svn import will not recursively create directories
for you:

$ svn import -m "New import" http://svn.red-bean.com/repos/test myproj trunk/vendors/myproj
Adding         myproj/sample.txt
...
Transmitting file data .........

svn list

svn list URL [URL ... ]

If URL is a file, just file entry will be displayed.

Alternate names: ls
Changes: Nothing
Needs Network: Yes
Switches:
--revision (-r) REV
--verbose (-v)
--recursive (-R)
--username USER
--password PASS

svn list is most useful if you want to see what files a repository has
without downloading a working copy:

$ svn list http://svn.red-bean.com/repos/test/support
README.txt
INSTALL

============================================================

svn log

svn log [URL] [PATH [PATH ... ]]

Print the log messages for local PATHs, or for PATHs under
URL, if URL is given.  If URL is given by itself, then print log
messages for everything under it.  With -v, also print all affected
paths with each log message.  With -q, don't print the log message
body itself (note that this is compatible with -v).

Each log message is printed just once, even if more than one of the
affected paths for that revision were explicitly requested.  Logs
cross copy history by default; use --strict to disable this.

Alternate names: None
Changes: Nothing
Needs Network: Yes
Switches:
--revision (-r) REV
--quiet (-q)
--verbose (-v)
--targets FILENAME
--username USER
--password PASS
--no-auth-cache
--non-interactive
--strict
--incremental
--xml

Examples

You can see the log messages for all the paths that changed in your
working copy by running svn log from the top:

$ svn log
------------------------------------------------------------------------
rev 20:  harry | 2003-01-17 22:56:19 -0600 (Fri, 17 Jan 2003) | 1 line

Tweak.
------------------------------------------------------------------------
rev 17:  sally | 2003-01-16 23:21:19 -0600 (Thu, 16 Jan 2003) | 2 lines
...

Examine all log messages for a particular file in your working copy:

$ svn log foo.c
------------------------------------------------------------------------
rev 32:  sally | 2003-01-13 16:43:13 -0600 (Mon, 13 Jan 2003) | 1 line

------------------------------------------------------------------------
rev 28:  sally | 2003-01-07 21:48:33 -0600 (Tue, 07 Jan 2003) | 3 lines
...

If you don't have a working copy handy, you can log a URL:

$ svn log http://svn.red-bean.com/repos/test/foo.c
------------------------------------------------------------------------
rev 32:  sally | 2003-01-13 16:43:13 -0600 (Mon, 13 Jan 2003) | 1 line

Added defines.
------------------------------------------------------------------------
rev 28:  sally | 2003-01-07 21:48:33 -0600 (Tue, 07 Jan 2003) | 3 lines
...

Warning: If you run svn log on a specific path and provide a specific
revision and get no output at all

$ svn log -r 20 http://svn.red-bean.com/untouched.txt
------------------------------------------------------------------------

That just means that the path was not modified in that revision.  If
you log from the top of the repository, or know the file that changed
in that revision, you can specify it explicitly:

$ svn log -r 20 touched.txt 
------------------------------------------------------------------------
rev 20:  sally | 2003-01-17 22:56:19 -0600 (Fri, 17 Jan 2003) | 1 line

Made a change.
------------------------------------------------------------------------

============================================================

svn merge
svn merge URL1[@N] URL2[@M] [PATH]
svn merge -r N:M TARGET [PATH]

In the first form, URL1 and URL2 are URLs specified at revisions N and
M.  These are the two sources to be compared.  The revisions default to
HEAD if omitted.

In the second form TARGET can be an URL, or it can be a working copy
path in which case the corresponding URL is used.  This URL, at
revisions N and M, defines the two sources to be compared.

PATH is the working copy path that will receive the changes.  If
omitted, a default value of '.' is assumed.

Alternate names: None
Changes: Working copy
Needs Network: Only if working with URLs
Switches:
--revision (-r) REV
--non-recursive (-N)
--quiet (-q)
--force
--dry-run
--username USER

Examples

merge a branch back into the trunk (assuming that you are a working
copy of the trunk):

$ svn merge http://svn.red-bean.com/repos/trunk/vendors http://svn.red-bean.com/repos/branches/vendors-with-fix
U  myproj/tiny.txt
U  myproj/thhgttg.txt
U  myproj/win.txt
U  myproj/flo.txt

If you branched at revision 23, and you want to merge changes on trunk
into your branch, you could do this from inside the working copy of
your branch:

$ svn merge -r 23:30 file:///tmp/repos/trunk/vendors
U  myproj/thhgttg.txt
...

============================================================

svn mkdir

svn mkdir TARGET [TARGET [TARGET ... ]]

Create a directory with a name given by the final component of
TARGET.  If TARGET is a working copy path the directory is scheduled
for addition in the working copy.  If TARGET is an URL the directory
is created in the repository via an immediate commit.  In both cases
all the intermediate directories must already exist.

Alternate names: None
Changes: Working copy, repository if operating on a URL
Needs Network: Only if operating on a URL
Switches:
--message (-m) TEXT
--file (-F) FILE
--quiet (-q)
--username USER
--password PASS

Examples

Create a directory in your working copy:

$ svn mkdir newdir
A         newdir

Create on in the repository (instant commit, so a log message is
required):

$ svn mkdir -m "Making a new dir." http://svn.red-bean.com/repos/newdir

Committed revision 26.

============================================================

svn move
svn move SRC DST

NOTE:  this command is equivalent to a 'copy' and 'delete'.

SRC and DST can both be working copy (WC) paths or URLs:
  WC  -&gt; WC:   move and schedule for addition (with history)
  URL -&gt; URL:  complete server-side rename.


Alternate names: mv, rename, ren
Changes: Working copyyy, repository if operating on a URL

--message (-m) TEXT
--file (-F) FILE
--revision (-r) REV
--quiet (-q)
--username USER
--password PASS
--no-auth-cache
--non-interactive
--force
--encoding ENC

Examples

Move a file in your working copy:

$ svn mv foo.c bar.c
A         bar.c
D         foo.c

Move a file in the repository (an immediate commit, so it requires a
commit message): 

$ svn mv -m "Move a file" http://svn.red-bean.com/repos/foo.c http://svn.red-bean.com/repos/bar.c

Committed revision 27.

Note: Currently, Subversion does not support copying between URLs and
your working copy.

============================================================

svn propset

svn propset PROPNAME [PROPVAL | -F VALFILE] PATH [PATH [PATH ... ]]
svn propset PROPNAME --revprop -r REV [PROPVAL | -F VALFILE] [URL]

The first creates a versioned, local propchange in working copy.

The second creates an unversioned, remote propchange on a repository
revision.

Note: svn recognizes the following special versioned properties
but will store any arbitrary properties set:

  svn:ignore     - A newline separated list of file patterns to ignore.

  svn:keywords   - Keywords to be expanded.  Valid keywords are:
    URL, HeadURL             - The URL for the head version of the object.
    Author, LastChangedBy    - The last person to modify the file.
    Date, LastChangedDate    - The date/time the object was last modified.
    Rev, LastChangedRevision - The last revision the object changed.
    Id                       - A compressed summary of the previous
                                 4 keywords.

  svn:executable - If present, make the file executable. This
    property cannot be set on a directory.  A non-recursive attempt
    will fail, and a recursive attempt will set the property only
    on the file children of the directory.

  svn:eol-style  - One of 'native', 'LF', 'CR', 'CRLF'. 

  svn:mime-type - The mimetype of the file.  Used to determine whether
    to merge the file, and how to serve it from Apache.  A mimetype
    beginning with 'text/' (or an absent mimetype) is treated as text.
    Anything else is treated as binary. The Internet media type
    registry is at http://www.iana.org/assignments/media-types/

  svn:externals  - A newline separated list of module specifiers,
    each of which consists of a relative directory path, optional
    revision flags, and an URL.  For example
      foo             http://example.com/repos/zig
      foo/bar -r 1234 http://example.com/repos/zag

Alternate names: pset, ps
Changes: working copy, repository only if operating on a URL
Needs Network: Only if operating on a URL
Switches:
--file (-F) FILE
--quiet (-q)
--revision (-r) REV
--targets FILENAME
--recursive (-R)
--revprop
--encoding ENC

Examples

Set the mimetype on a file:

$ svn propest svn:mime-type image/jpeg foo.jpg 
property `svn:mime-type' set on 'foo.jpg'

If you want a file to have the executable bit set:

$ svn ps svn:executable ON somescript
property `svn:executable' set on 'somescript'

Perhaps you have an internal policy to set certain properties for the
benefit of your coworkers:

$ svn propset owner sally foo.c
property `owner' set on 'foo.c'

If you made a mistake in a log message for a particular revision and
want to change it, use --revprop and set svn:log to the new log
message:

$ svn propset --revprop -r 25 svn:log "Journaled about trip to New York."
property `svn:log' set on repository revision '25'

Or, if you don't have a working copy, you can provide a URL.

$ svn propset --revprop -r 26 svn:log "Document nap." http://svn.red-bean.com/repos
property `svn:log' set on repository revision '25'

NOTE: 1. By default, you cannot modify revprops in a Subversion
repository.  Your repository administrator must explicitly enable
revprop modifications by creating a hook named
'pre-revprop-change'. See <xref linkend="svn-ch-5-sect-2.1"/> for more
information on hook scripts.

============================================================

svn propdel

svn propdel PROPNAME [PATH [PATH ... ]]
svn propdel PROPNAME --revprop -r REV [URL]

The first  removes versioned props in working copy.

The second removes unversioned remote prop on repos revision.

Alternate names: pdel
Changes: working copy, repository only if operating on a URL
Needs Network: Only if operating on a URL
Switches:
--quiet (-q)
--recursive (-R)
--revision (-r) REV
--revprop

Examples

Delete a property from a file in your working copy

$ svn propdel svn:mime-type  some-script
property `svn:mime-type' deleted from 'some-script'.

Delete a revprop

$ svn propdel --revprop -r 26 release-date 
property `release-date' deleted from repository revision '26'

============================================================

svn propedit

svn propedit PROPNAME PATH [PATH [PATH ... ]]
svn propedit PROPNAME --revprop -r REV [URL]

The first edits versioned props in working copy.

The second edits unversioned remote prop on repos revision.

Alternate names: pedit, pe
Changes: working copy, repository only if operating on a URL
Needs Network: Only if operating on a URL
Switches:
--revision (-r) REV
--revprop
--encoding ENC

Examples

svn propedit makes it easy to modify properties that have multiple
values:

$ svn propedit svn:keywords  foo.jpg 
    &lt;svn will launch your favorite editor here, with a buffer open
    containing the current contents of the svn:keywords property.  You
    can add multiple values to a property easily here by entering one
    value per line.&gt;
Set new value for property `svn:keywords' on `foo.c'

============================================================

svn propget

svn propget PROPNAME [PATH [PATH ... ]]
svn propget PROPNAME --revprop -r REV [URL]

The first prints versioned prop in working copy.

The second prints unversioned remote prop on repos revision.

Alternate names: pget, pg
Changes: working copy, repository only if operating on a URL
Needs Network: Only if operating on a URL
Switches:
--recursive (-R)
--revision (-r) REV
--revprop

Examples

Examine a prop for a file in your working copy

$ svn propget svn:keywords foo.c
AuthorLastChangedBy
Rev

The same goes for a revprop:

$ svn propget svn:log --revprop -r 20 
Began journal.

============================================================

svn proplist

svn proplist [PATH [PATH ... ]]
svn proplist --revprop -r REV [URL]

The first lists versioned props in working copy.

The second lists unversioned remote props on repos revision.

Alternate names: plist, pl
Changes: working copy, repository only if operating on a URL
Needs Network: Only if operating on a URL
Switches:
--verbose (-v)
--recursive (-R)
--revision (-r) REV
--revprop

Examples

You can use proplist to see the properties on an item in your working copy:

$ svn proplist foo.c
Properties on 'foo.c':
  svn:mime-type
  svn:keywords
  owner

But with the --verbose flag, svn proplist is extremely handy as it
also shows you the values for the properties:

$ svn proplist --verbose foo.c
Properties on 'foo.c':
  svn:mime-type : text/plain
  svn:keywords : AuthorLastChangedBy
Rev
  owner : sally

============================================================

svn revert

svn revert PATH [PATH [PATH ... ]]

Reverts any local changes to a file and resolves any conflicted
states.

Alternate names: None
Changes: working copy
Needs Network: No
Switches:
--targets FILENAME
--recursive (-R)
--quiet (-q)

Examples

Discard changes to a file:

$ svn revert foo.c
Reverted foo.c

If you want to revert a whole directory of files, use the --recursive flag:

$svn revert --recursive .
Reverted newdir/afile
Reverted foo.c
Reverted bar.txt

Note: If you provide no targets to svn revert, it will do nothing--to
protect you from accidentally losing changes in your working copy, svn
revert requires you to provide at least one target.

============================================================

svn resolve

svn resolve PATH [PATH [PATH ... ]]

Note: this routine does not semantically resolve conflict markers; it
merely removes conflict-related artifact files and allows PATH to be
committed again.

Alternate names: None
Changes: Working copy
Needs Network: No
Switches:
--targets FILENAME
--recursive (-R)
--quiet (-q)

Examples

If you get a conflict on an update, your working copy will sprout
three new files:

$ svn up
C  foo.c
Updated to revision 31.
$ ls
foo.c
foo.c.mine
foo.c.r30
foo.c.r31

Once you've resolved the conflict and foo.c is ready to be committed,
run 'svn resolve' to let your working copy know you've taken care of
everything.

Note: You <emphasis>can</emphasis> just remove the conflict files and
commit, but svn resolve fixes up some bookkeeping data in the working
copy administrative area in addition to removing the conflict files,
so we recommend that you use this command.

============================================================

svn status
svn status [PATH [PATH ... ]]

  With no args, print only locally modified items (no network access).
  With -u, add working revision and server out-of-date information.
  With -v, print full revision information on every item.

The first five columns in the output are each one character wide:
    First column: Says if item was added, deleted, or otherwise changed
      ' ' no modifications
      'A' Added
      'D' Deleted
      'M' Modified
      'C' Conflicted
      '?' item is not under revision control
      '!' item is missing and was removed via a non-svn command
      '~' versioned as a directory, but is a file, or vice versa
    Second column: Modifications of a file's or directory's properties
      ' ' no modifications
      'M' Modified
      'C' Conflicted
    Third column: Whether the working copy directory is locked
      ' ' not locked
      'L' locked
    Fourth column: Scheduled commit will contain addition-with-history
      ' ' no history scheduled with commit
      '+' history scheduled with commit
    Fifth column: Whether the item is switched relative to its parent
      ' ' normal
      'S' switched
    The out-of-date information appears in the eighth column
      '*' a newer revision exists on the server
      ' ' the working copy is up to date

Remaining fields are variable width and delimited by spaces:

The working revision is the next field if -u or -v is given, followed
by both the last committed revision and last committed author if -v is
given.  The working copy path is always the final field, so it can
include spaces.

============================================================

svn switch

svn switch URL [PATH]

Note:  this is the way to move a working copy to a new branch.

Alternate names: sw
Changes: working copy
Needs Network: Yes
Switches:
--revision (-r) REV
--non-recursive (-N)
--quiet (-q)
--username USER
--password PASS
--no-auth-cache
--non-interactive

Examples

If you're currently inside the directory 'vendors' which was branched
to 'vendors-with-fix' and you'd like to switch your working copy to
that branch:

$ svn switch http://svn.red-bean.com/repos/branches/vendors-with-fix .
U  myproj/foo.txt
U  myproj/bar.txt
U  myproj/baz.c
U  myproj/qux.c
Updated to revision 31.

And to switch back, just provide the URL to the location in the
repository that your working copy was at before:

$ svn switch http://svn.red-bean.com/repos/trunk/vendors .
U  myproj/foo.txt
U  myproj/bar.txt
U  myproj/baz.c
U  myproj/qux.c
Updated to revision 31.

Tip: You can just switch a subdirectory deep inside of your working
copy if you don't want to switch your entire working copy.

============================================================

svn update

svn update [PATH [PATH ... ]]

If no revision given, bring working copy up-to-date with HEAD rev.
Else synchronize working copy to revision given by -r.

For each updated item a line will start with a character reporting the
action taken.  These characters have the following meaning:

  A  Added
  D  Deleted
  U  Updated
  C  Conflict
  G  Merged

A character in the first column signifies an update to the actual file,
while updates to the file's props are shown in the second column.

Alternate names: up
Changes: Working copy
Needs Network: Yes
Switches:
--revision (-r) REV
--non-recursive (-N)
--quiet (-q)
--username USER
--password PASS
--no-auth-cache
--non-interactive

Examples

Pick up repository changes that have happened since your last update:

$ svn up
A  newdir/toggle.c
A  newdir/disclose.c
A  newdir/launch.c
D  newdir/README
Updated to revision 32.

You can also update your working copy to an older revision:

svn up -r30
A  newdir/README
D  newdir/toggle.c
D  newdir/disclose.c
D  newdir/launch.c
U  foo.c
Updated to revision 30.

Tip: If you want to examine an older revision of a single file, you
may want to use 'svn cat' (###TODO xref)
