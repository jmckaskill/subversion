    </blockquote>

    <para>In the world of open-source software, the Concurrent
      Versions System (CVS) has long been the tool of choice for
      version control.  And rightly so.  CVS itself is free software,
      and its non-restrictive <foreignphrase>modus
      operandus</foreignphrase> and support for networked
      operation&mdash;which allow dozens of geographically dispersed
      programmers to share their work&mdash;fits the collaborative
      nature of the open-source world very well.  CVS and its
      semi-chaotic development model have become cornerstones of
      open-source culture.
    </para>

    <para>But like many tools, CVS is starting to show its age.
      Subversion is a relatively new version control system designed
      to be the successor to CVS.  The designers set out to win the
      hearts of CVS users in two ways: by creating an open-source
      system with a design (and <quote>look and feel</quote>) similar
      to CVS, and by attempting to fix most of CVS's noticeable flaws.
      While the result isn't necessarily the next great evolution in
      version control design, Subversion <emphasis>is</emphasis> very
      powerful, very usable, and very flexible.
    </para>

    <para>This book is written to document version 1.0.1 of the
      Subversion version control system.  We have made attempt to be
      thorough in our coverage.  However, Subversion has a thriving
      and energetic development community, so there are already a
      number of features and improvements planned for future versions
      of Subversion that may change some of the commands and specific
      notes in this book.

    <title>Audience</title>
    
    <para>This book is written for computer literate folk who want to
      use Subversion to manage their data.  While Subversion runs on a
      number of different operating systems, its primary user
      interface is command-line based.  For that reason, the examples
      in this book assume the reader is using a Unix-like operating
      system, and is relatively comfortable with Unix and command-line
      interfaces.</para>

    <para>Not to fear, Microsoft Windows users can download a
      pre-compiled Windows native Subversion command-line client that
      works in the Command Prompt application.  Many examples of the
      client will work in the Command Prompt, but you may have more
      success if you run the examples inside the Cygwin Unix emulation
      environment.</para>

    <para>Most readers are probably programmers or sysadmins who need
      to track changes to source code; this is the most common use for
      Subversion, and therefore it is the scenario underlying all of
      the book's examples.  But keep in mind that Subversion can be
      used to manage changes to any sort of information: images,
      music, databases, documentation, and so on.  To Subversion, all
      data is just data.</para>
    
    <para>While this book is written with the assumption that the
      reader has never used version control, we've also tried to make
      it easy for former CVS users to get up to speed quickly.
      Special sidebars may discuss CVS from time to time, and a
      special appendix summarizes most of the differences between CVS
      and Subversion.</para>

    <title>How to Read this Book</title>

    <para>This book aims to be useful to people of widely different
      backgrounds: from people with no experience in version control,
      all the way up to experienced sysadmins.  Depending on your own
      background, certain chapters may be more or less important to
      you.</para>

    <para>What kind of reader are you?</para>

    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem><para>
          <emphasis>The experienced sysadmin or computer geek.</emphasis>

          The assumption here is that you've probably used CVS before,
          and are dying to get a Subversion server up and running
          ASAP.  Chapters 5 and 6 will show you how to create your
          first repository and make it available over the network.
          After that's done, chapter 3 and appendix A are the fastest
          routes to learning the Subversion client while drawing on
          your CVS experience.</para></listitem>

      <listitem><para>
          <emphasis>The new user.</emphasis>

          Your administrator has probably set up Subversion already,
          and you need to learn how to use the client.  If you've
          never used CVS (or have never used a version control
          system), then chapters 2 and 3 are a vital introduction.  If
          you're already an old hand at CVS, chapter 3 and appendix A 
          are the best place to start.</para></listitem>

      <listitem><para>
          <emphasis>The advanced user.</emphasis>

          Whether you're a user or administrator, eventually your
          project will grow larger.  You're going to want to learn how
          to do more advanced things with Subversion, such as
          branching and merging (chapter 4), set metadata properties
          and configure runtime options (chapter 7), and other things.
          Chapters 4 and 7 aren't vital at first, but be sure to read
          them once you're comfortable with the
          basics.</para></listitem>

      <listitem><para>
          <emphasis>The developer.</emphasis>

          Presumably, you're already familiar with Subversion, and now
          want to either extend it, or build new software on top of
          its many APIs.  Chapter 8 is just for you.</para></listitem>
      </itemizedlist>

    <para>The book ends with reference material: chapter 9 is a
      reference guide for all Subversion commands, and the appendices
      cover a number of useful topics.  These are the chapters you're
      mostly likely to come back to after you've finished the
      book.</para>
