    <para>
      In the world of open-source software, the Concurrent Versions
      System (CVS) has long been the tool of choice for version
      control.  And rightly so.  CVS itself is free software, and its
      wonderful <quote>non-locking</quote> system&mdash;which allows
      dozens of far-flung programmers to share their work&mdash;fits
      the collaborative nature of the open-source world very well.  CVS
      and its semi-chaotic development model have become cornerstones
      of open-source culture.
    </para>

    <para>
      But like many tools, CVS is starting to show its age.
      Subversion is a relatively new version control system designed
      to be the successor to CVS.  The designers set out to win the
      hearts of CVS users in two ways: by creating an open-source
      system with a design (and "look and feel") similar to CVS, and
      by attempting to fix most of CVS's noticeable flaws.  While the
      result isn't necessarily the next great evolution in version
      control design, Subversion <emphasis>is</emphasis> very
      powerful, very usable, and very flexible.

    <title>Audience</title>
    
    <para>This book is written for computer literate folk who want to
      use Subversion to manage their data.  While Subversion runs on a
      number of different operating systems, its primary user
      interface is command-line based.  For that reason, the examples
      in this book assume the reader is using a Unix-like operating
      system, and is relatively comfortable with Unix and command-line
      interfaces.</para>

    <para>Most readers are probably programmers or sysadmins who need
      to track changes to source code; this is the most common use for
      Subversion, and therefore it is the scenario underlying all of
      the book's examples.  But keep in mind that Subversion can be
      used to manage changes to any sort of information: images,
      music, databases, documentation, and so on.  To Subversion, all
      data is just data.</para>
    
    <para>While this book is written with the assumption that the
      reader has never used version control, we've also tried to make
      it easy for former CVS users to get up to speed quickly.
      Special sidebars may discuss CVS from time to time, and a
      special appendix summarizes most of the differences between CVS
      and Subversion.</para>

    <title>How This Book is Organized</title>

    <para>The first three chapters of this book form a general
      introduction to Subversion.  We begin with a discussion of
      Subversion's features, discuss its design and user model, and
      then lead into a guided tour.  All readers, regardless of
      experience, should read these chapters.  They form the backbone
      of the rest of the book.</para>

    <para>Chapters four, five, and six discuss the more complex topics
      of branching, repository administration, and advanced features
      such as properties, externals, and access control.  Sysadmins
      and power-users will definitely want to read these
      chapters.</para>

    <para>Chapter seven is specially written for programmers who want
      to use Subversion's APIs in their own software, or want to work
      on Subversion itself.</para>

    <para>The book ends with reference material: chapter eight is a
      reference guide for all Subversion commands, and the appendices
      cover a number of useful topics.  These are the chapters you're
      mostly likely to come back to after you've finished the
      book.</para>

    <title>Conventions Used in This Book</title>

    <para>### O'Reilly almost certainly needs to fill this in,
      depending on how they typeset the book.</para>

    <para>Note that the source code examples are just
      that&mdash;examples. While they will compile with the proper
      compiler incantations, they are intended to illustrate the
      problem at hand, not necessarily serve as examples of good
      programming style.</para>

    <title>This Book is Free</title>

    <para>This book started out as bits of documentation written by
      Subversion project developers, which were then coalesced into a
      single work and rewritten.  As such, it has always had the same
      free, open-source license as Subversion itself.  In fact, the
      book was written in the public eye, as a part of Subversion.
      This means two things:</para>

        <para>You will always find the latest version of this book in

      <listitem>
        <para>You can distribute and make changes to this book however
          you wish &mdash; it's under a free license.  Of course,
          rather than distribute your own private version of this
          book, we'd much rather you send feedback and patches to the
          Subversion developer community.  See <xref

          community.</para>
