  <title>Third Party Tools</title>

  <simplesect>

    <para>Subversion's modular design (covered in <xref
      linkend="svn-ch-8-sect-1" />) and the availability of language
      bindings (as described in <xref linkend="svn-ch-8-sect-2.3" />)
      make Subversion a likely candidate for use as an extension or
      backend to other pieces of software.  In this appendix, we'll
      introduce you to some of the third-party tools which are using
      Subversion.  We will not cover actual Subversion
      clients&mdash;see <xref linkend="svn-ap-e" /> for those.

    <para>Perhaps the first&mdash;and definitely the most
      popular&mdash;utility to take advantage of Subversion's public
      API is ViewCVS.  ViewCVS is essentially a CGI script which
      enables browsing of the files and directories of a version
      control system.  Originally designed as a Python-based
      replacement for the popular cvsweb utility,
      <footnote>
        <para>CVSWeb was written in Perl.</para>
      </footnote>
      ViewCVS provides a full-featured Web-based interface to CVS
      repositories, allowing folks to see the version control history
      of the files in those repositories and to perform such nifty
      tasks as generating differences between arbitrary versions of
      those files.</para>

    <para>In the early part of 2002, the repository accessing portion
      of ViewCVS was modularized into a semi-generic interface, and a
      pair of modules were grown to provide that functionality for CVS
      repositories.  Later that year, Subversion's Python language
      bindings sufficiently matured, and a Subversion repository
      module was written for the ViewCVS interface.  Now, ViewCVS is
      able to browse Subversion repositories, providing essentially
      the same history and differencing mechanisms for those
      repositories as are available for CVS ones.</para>

    <para>SubWiki is a Subversion-backed Wiki program.  Wikis have
      sprung up on the World Wide Web as unique publishing and
      community tools&mdash;essentially, web-based interfaces for
      editing web pages.  SubWiki takes the Wiki concept one step
      further by using a version control system for its backend
      storage mechanism.  The result is a CGI program which allows web
      pages to be essentially edited in-place, yet never loses old
      versions of those web pages.</para>
