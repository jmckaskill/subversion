    <para>A bad Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) sheet is one that is
    composed not of the questions people actually asked, but of the
    questions the FAQ's author <emphasis>wished</emphasis> people had
    asked.  Perhaps you've seen the type before: </para>

    <blockquote>
      <para>Q: How can I use Glorbosoft XYZ to maximize team
        productivity?</para>
    </blockquote>

    <blockquote>
      <para>A: Many of our customers want to know how they can
        maximize productivity through our patented office groupware
        innovations.  The answer is simple: first, click on the
        <quote><literal>File</literal></quote> menu, scroll down to
        <quote><literal>Increase&nbsp;Productivity</literal></quote>,
        then&hellip;
        </para>
    </blockquote>

    <para>The problem with such FAQs is that they are not, in a
    literal sense, FAQs at all.  No one ever called the tech support
    line and asked, <quote>How can we maximize productivity?</quote>.
    Rather, people asked highly specific questions, like, <quote>How
    can we change the calendaring system to send reminders two days in
    advance instead of one?</quote> and so on.  But it's a lot easier
    to make up imaginary Frequently Asked Questions than it is to
    discover the real ones.  Compiling a true FAQ sheet requires a
    sustained, organized effort: over the lifetime of the software,
    incoming questions must be tracked, responses monitored, and all
    gathered into a coherent, searchable whole that reflects the
    collective experience of users in the wild.  It calls for the
    patient, observant attitude of a field naturalist.  No grand
    hypothesizing, no visionary pronouncements here&mdash;open eyes
    and accurate note-taking are what's needed most. </para>

    <para>What I love about this book is that it grew out of just such
    a process, and shows it on every page.  It is the direct result of
    the authors' encounters with users.  It began with Ben
    Collins-Sussman's observation that people were asking the same
    basic questions over and over on the Subversion mailing lists:
    What are the standard workflows to use with Subversion?  Do
    branches and tags work the same way as in other version control
    systems?  How can I find out who made a particular change? </para>

    <para>Frustrated at seeing the same questions day after day, Ben
    worked intensely over a month in the summer of 2002 to write
    <citetitle>The Subversion Handbook</citetitle>, a sixty page
    manual that covered all the basics of using Subversion.  The
    manual made no pretense of being complete, but it was distributed
    with Subversion and got users over that initial hump in the
    learning curve.  When O'Reilly and Associates decided to publish a
    full-length Subversion book, the path of least resistance was
    obvious: just expand the Subversion handbook. </para>

    <para>The three co-authors of the new book were thus presented
    with an unusual opportunity.  Officially, their task was to write
    a book top-down, starting from a table of contents and an initial
    draft.  But they also had access to a steady stream&mdash;indeed,
    an uncontrollable geyser&mdash;of bottom-up source material.
    Subversion was already in the hands of thousands of early
    adopters, and those users were giving tons of feedback, not only
    about Subversion, but about its existing documentation. </para>

    <para>During the entire time they wrote this book, Ben, Mike, and
    Fitz haunted the Subversion mailing lists and chat rooms
    incessantly, carefully noting the problems real people were having
    in real situations.  The book they produced reflects this.
    Grounded firmly in the bedrock of experience, not in the shifting
    sands of wishful thinking, it combines the best aspects of user
    manual and FAQ sheet.  This duality might not be noticeable on a
    first reading.  Taken in order, front to back, the book is simply
    a straightforward description of a piece of software.  There's the
    overview, the obligatory guided tour, the chapter on
    administrative configuration, some advanced topics, and of course
    a command reference and troubleshooting guide.  Only when you come
    back to it later, seeking the solution to some specific problem,
    does its authenticity shine out: the telling details that can only
    result from encounters with the unexpected, the examples honed
    from genuine use cases, and most of all the sensitivity to the
    user's needs and the user's point of view. </para>

    <para> Of course, no one can promise that this book will answer
    every question you have about Subversion.  Sometimes, the
    precision with which it anticipates your questions will seem
    eerily telepathic; yet occasionally, you will stumble into a hole
    in the community's knowledge, and come away empty-handed.  When
    this happens, the best thing you can do is email
    <email>users@subversion.tigris.org</email> and present your
    problem.  The authors are still there, still watching, and they
    include not just the three listed on the cover, but many others
    who contributed corrections and original material.  From the
    community's point of view, solving your problem is merely a
    pleasant side effect of a much larger project&mdash;namely, slowly
    adjusting this book, and ultimately Subversion itself, to more
    closely match the way people actually use it.  They are eager to
    hear from you not merely because they can help you, but because
    you can help them.  With Subversion as with all active free
    software projects, <emphasis>you are not alone</emphasis>.
    </para>

    <para>Let this book be your first companion. </para>
