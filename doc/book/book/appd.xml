      <para>The Subversion command line client,
        <command>svn</command>, is the official<footnote><para>Because
        we says so, that's why.</para></footnote> implementation of a
        Subversion client.  Fortunately for those interested in
        developing additional Subversion clients, Subversion is
        implemented as a series of libraries.  These libraries are
        accessible via C API, as well as other languages (see <xref
        linkend="svn-ch-8-sect-2.3"/>).</para>

      <para>This component design means that it's easy (well, at least
        <emphasis>easier</emphasis>) to write clients and utilities
        using these libraries.  As a result, even pre-1.0, there are a
        number of GUI clients available for Subversion, each in
        various phases of development.</para>

      <para>We used to describe all those clients here, but lately
        there are too many of them, and they're moving too fast, for a
        printed manual to keep track of them.  So instead, we
        recommend you to the links page at <systemitem class="url"
        >http://subversion.tigris.org/project_links.html</systemitem>,
        which is kept reasonably up to date.</para>
