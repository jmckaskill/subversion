  <title>Guided Tour</title>

  <simplesect>

    <para>Now we will go into the details of using Subversion.  By the
      time you reach the end of this chapter, you will be able to
      perform almost all the tasks you need to use Subversion in a
      normal day's work.  You'll start with an initial checkout of
      your code, and walk through making changes and examining those
      changes. You'll also see how to bring changes made by others
      into your working copy, examine them, and work through any
      conflicts that might arise.</para>

    <para>Note that this chapter is not meant to be an exhaustive list
      of all Subversion's commands&mdash;rather, it's a conversational
      introduction to the most common Subversion tasks you'll
      encounter.  This chapter assumes that you've read and understood
      <xref linkend="svn-ch-2"/> and are familiar with the general
      model of Subversion.  For a complete reference of all commands,
      see <xref linkend="svn-ch-9"/>.</para>

    <title>Help!</title>


    <para>Before reading on, here is the most important command you'll
      ever need when using Subversion: <command>svn help</command>.
      The Subversion command-line client is
      self-documenting&mdash;at any time, a quick <command>svn help
      &lt;subcommand&gt;</command> will describe the syntax, switches,
      and behavior of the <command>subcommand</command>.</para>

    <title>Import</title>

    <para>You use <command>svn import</command> to import a new
    project into a Subversion repository.  While this is most likely
    the very first thing you will do when you set up your Subversion
    server, it's not something that happens very often.  For a
    detailed description of import, see <xref
    linkend="svn-ch-3-sect-7.3"/> later in this chapter.

    <title>Revisions: Numbers, Keywords, and Dates, Oh My!</title>

    <para>Before we go on, you should know a bit about how to identify
      a particular revision in your repository.  As you learned in
      <xref linkend="svn-ch-2-sect-3.2"/>, a revision is a
      <quote>snapshot</quote> of the repository at a particular moment
      in time.  As you continue to commit and grow your repository,
      you need a mechanism for identifying these snapshots.</para>

    <para>You specify these revisions by using the
      <option>--revision</option> (<option>-r</option>) switch plus
      the revision you want (<command>svn --revision REV</command>) or
      you can specify a range by separating two revisions with a colon
      (<command>svn --revision REV1:REV2</command>).  And Subversion
      lets you refer to these revisions by number, keyword, or
      date.</para>
    
    <sect2 id="svn-ch-3-sect-3.1">
      <title>Revision Numbers</title>
      
      <para>When you create a new Subversion repository, it begins its
        life at revision zero and each successive commit increases the
        revision number by one.  After your commit completes, the
        Subversion client informs you of the new revision
        number:</para>
      
      <screen>
$ svn commit --message "Corrected number of cheese slices."
Sending        sandwich.txt
Transmitting file data .
Committed revision 3.
</screen>

      <para>If at any point in the future you want to refer to that
        revision (we'll see how and why we might want to do that later
        in this chapter), you can refer to it as
        <quote>3</quote>.</para>

    </sect2>
    
    <sect2 id="svn-ch-3-sect-3.2">
      <title>Revision Keywords</title>
      
      <para>The Subversion client understands a number of
        <firstterm>revision keywords</firstterm>.  These keywords
        can be used instead of integer arguments to the
        <option>--revision</option> switch, and are resolved into
        specific revision numbers by Subversion:</para>

      <note>
        <para>Each directory in your working copy contains an
        <filename>.svn</filename> administrative area.  For every file
        in a directory, Subversion keeps a copy of each file in the
        administrative area.  This copy is an unmodified (no keyword
        expansion, no end-of-line translation, no nothing) copy of the
        file as it existed in the last revision (called the
        <quote>BASE</quote> revision) that you updated it to in your
        working copy.  We refer to this file as a
        <quote>pristine</quote> copy.</para>

      <variablelist>

        <varlistentry>

        </varlistentry>
        
      </variablelist>
      
      <para>Here are some examples of revision keywords in action
        (don't worry if the commands don't make sense yet; we'll be
        explaining these commands as we go through the
        chapter):</para>
      
      <screen>
$ svn diff --revision PREV:COMMITTED foo.c
# shows the last change committed to foo.c

$ svn log --revision HEAD
# shows log message for the latest repository commit

$ svn diff --revision HEAD
# compares your working file (with local mods) to the latest version
# in the repository.

$ svn diff --revision BASE:HEAD foo.c
# compares your <quote>pristine</quote> foo.c (no local mods) with the 
# latest version in the repository

$ svn log --revision BASE:HEAD
# shows all commit logs since you last updated

$ svn update --revision PREV foo.c
# rewinds the last change on foo.c.
# (foo.c's working revision is decreased.)
</screen>
      
      <para>These keywords allow you to perform many common (and
        helpful) operations without having to look up specific
        revision numbers or remember the exact revision of your
        working copy.</para>
      
    </sect2>
    
    <sect2 id="svn-ch-3-sect-3.3">
      <title>Revision Dates</title>
      
      <para>Anywhere that you specify a revision number or revision
        keyword, you can also specify a date by specifying the date
        inside curly braces <quote>{}</quote>.  You can even access
        a range of changes in the repository using both dates and
        revisions together!</para>
      
      <para>Here are examples of the date formats that Subversion
        accepts.  Remember to use quotes around any date that contains
        spaces.</para>

      <screen>
$ svn checkout --revision {2002-02-17}
$ svn checkout --revision {15:30}
$ svn checkout --revision {15:30:00.200000}
$ svn checkout --revision {"2002-02-17 15:30"}
$ svn checkout --revision {"2002-02-17 15:30 +0230"}
$ svn checkout --revision {2002-02-17T15:30}
$ svn checkout --revision {2002-02-17T15:30Z}

$ svn checkout --revision {20020217T1530-0500}
&hellip;
</screen>
      
      <para>When you specify a date as a revision, Subversion finds
        the most recent revision of the repository as of that
        date:</para>
        
      <screen>

      <sidebar>
        <title>Is Subversion a Day Early?</title>
        
        <para>If you specify a single date as a revision without
          specifying a time of day (for example
          <literal>2002-11-27</literal>), you may think that Subversion
          should give you the last revision that took place on the
          27th of November.  Instead, you'll get back a revision from
          the 26th, or even earlier.  Remember that Subversion will
          find the <emphasis>most recent revision of the
          repository</emphasis> as of the date you give.  If you give
          a date without a timestamp, like
          <literal>2002-11-27</literal>, Subversion assumes a time of
          00:00:00, so looking for the most recent revision won't
          return anything on the day of the 27th.</para>

        <para>If you want to include the 27th in your search, you can
          either specify the 27th with the time (<literal>2002-11-27
          23:59</literal>), or just specify the next day
          (<literal>2002-11-28</literal>).</para>
        
      </sidebar>
      
      <para>You can also use a range of dates.  Subversion will find
        all revisions between both dates, inclusive:</para>
      
      <screen>
$ svn log --revision {2002-11-20}:{2002-11-29}
&hellip;
</screen>
        
      <para>As we pointed out, you can also mix dates and revisions:</para>
      
      <screen>
$ svn log --revision {2002-11-20}:4040
</screen>

      <para>Users should be aware of a subtlety that can become quite
        a stumblingblock when dealing with dates in Subversion.  Since
        the timestamp of a revision is stored as a property of the
        revision&mdash;an unversioned, modifiable
        property&mdash;revision timestamps can be changed to represent
        complete falsifications of true chronology, or even removed
        altogether.  This will wreak havoc on the internal
        date-to-revision conversion that Subversion performs.</para>

    <title>Initial Checkout</title>

    <para>Most of the time, you will start using a Subversion
      repository by doing a <firstterm>checkout</firstterm> of your
      project.  <quote>Checking out</quote> a repository creates a
      copy of it on your local machine.  This copy contains the
      <literal>HEAD</literal> (latest revision) of the Subversion
      repository that you specify on the command line:</para>
    

    <screen>
$ svn checkout http://svn.collab.net/repos/svn/trunk
A  trunk/subversion.dsw
A  trunk/svn_check.dsp
A  trunk/COMMITTERS
A  trunk/configure.in
A  trunk/IDEAS
&hellip;
Checked out revision 2499.
</screen>
    
    <sidebar>
      <title>Repository Layout</title>

      <para>If you're wondering what <literal>trunk</literal> is all
        about in the above URL, it's part of the way we recommend
        you lay out your Subversion repository which we'll talk a lot
        more about in <xref linkend="svn-ch-4"/>.</para>

    </sidebar>

    <para>Although the above example checks out the trunk directory,
      you can just as easily check out any deep subdirectory of a
      repository by specifying the subdirectory in the checkout
      URL:</para>
    
    <screen>
$ svn checkout http://svn.collab.net/repos/svn/trunk/doc/book/tools
A  tools/readme-dblite.html
A  tools/fo-stylesheet.xsl
A  tools/svnbook.el
A  tools/dtd
A  tools/dtd/dblite.dtd
&hellip;
Checked out revision 3678.
</screen>
    
    <para>Since Subversion uses a <quote>copy-modify-merge</quote>
      model instead of <quote>lock-modify-unlock</quote> (see <xref
      linkend="svn-ch-2"/>), you're now ready to start making changes
      to the files and directories that you've checked out (known
      collectively as your <firstterm>working
      copy</firstterm>).</para>

    <para>In other words, your <quote>working copy</quote> is now just
      like any other collection of files and/or directories on your
      system<footnote><para>Well, except for the fact that every
      directory within your <quote>working copy</quote> also contains a
      <filename>.svn</filename> subdirectory.  But that's getting a
      little ahead of ourselves.</para></footnote>.  You can edit and
      change them, move them around, you can even delete the entire
      working copy and forget about it.</para>

      <note>
        <para>While your working copy is <quote>just like any other
          collection of files and directories on your system</quote>,
          you need to let Subversion know if you're going to be
          rearranging anything inside of your working copy.  If you
          want to copy or move an item in a working copy, you should
          use <command>svn copy</command> or <command>svn
          move</command> instead of the copy and move commands
          provided by your operating system.  We'll talk more about
          them later in this chapter.</para>
      </note>

    <para>Unless you're ready to <firstterm>commit</firstterm> a new
      file or directory, or changes to existing ones, there's no need
      to further notify the Subversion server that you've done
      anything.</para>

    <sidebar>
      <title>What's with the <filename>.svn</filename> directory?</title>

      <para>Every directory in a working copy contains an
        <firstterm>administrative area</firstterm>, a subdirectory
        named <filename>.svn</filename>.  Usually, directory listing
        commands won't show this subdirectory, but it is nevertheless
        an important directory.  Whatever you do, don't delete or
        change anything in the administrative area!  Subversion
        depends on it to manage your working copy.</para>

    </sidebar>

    <para>While you can certainly check out a working copy with the
      URL of the repository as the only argument, you can also specify
      a directory after your repository URL.  This places your working
      copy into the new directory that you name.  For example:</para>
    
    <screen>
$ svn checkout http://svn.collab.net/repos/svn/trunk subv
A  subv/subversion.dsw
A  subv/svn_check.dsp
A  subv/COMMITTERS
A  subv/configure.in
A  subv/IDEAS
&hellip;
Checked out revision 2499.
</screen>
    
    <para>That will place your working copy in a directory named
      <literal>subv</literal> instead of a directory named
      <literal>trunk</literal> as we did previously.</para>

      <title>Make Changes to Your Working Copy</title>
      
      <para>Now you can get to work and make changes in your
        working copy. It's usually most convenient to decide on a
        particular change (or set of changes) to make, such as writing
        a new feature, fixing a bug, etc.  The Subversion commands
        that you will use here are <command>svn add</command>,
        <command>svn delete</command>, <command>svn copy</command>,
        and <command>svn move</command>.  However, if you are merely
        editing a file (or files) that is already in Subversion, you
        may not need to use any of these commands until you commit.
        Changes you can make to your working copy:</para>

          <term>File changes</term>
          <listitem>
            <para>This is the simplest sort of change.  You don't need
              to tell Subversion that you intend to change a file;
              just make your changes.  Subversion will be able to
              automatically detect which files have been
              changed.</para>

              and directories for scheduled removal, addition,
              copying, or moving.  While these changes may take place
              immediately in your working copy, no additions or
              removals will happen in the repository until you commit
              them.</para>

        as it handles text files&mdash;and just as efficiently
        too.</para>

        <title>Changing the Repository Without a Working Copy</title>

        <!-- ### pll - Fri 07 Feb 2003 12:55:07                            -->
        <!-- I find this sidebar rather confusing here, since you really   -->
        <!-- haven't gone through explaining the svn command line syntax   -->
        <!-- anywhere.  Maybe a short section explaining that subversion   -->
        <!-- can be used both in networked and non-networked environments, -->
        <!-- and which types of commands need URLs, etc.  This should      -->
        <!-- probably be in chapter 2 (around the "Subversion in action"   -->
        <!-- though, so that this sidebar makes more sense.                -->
        
        <para>Earlier in this chapter, we said that you have to commit
          any changes that you make in order for the repository to
          reflect these changes. That's not entirely true&mdash;there
          <emphasis>are</emphasis> some use-cases that immediately
          commit tree changes to the repository.  This only happens
          when a subcommand is operating directly on a URL, rather
          than on a working-copy path. In particular, specific uses
          of <command>svn mkdir</command>, <command>svn
          copy</command>, <command>svn move</command>, and
          <command>svn delete</command> can work with URLs.</para>

        <para>URL operations behave in this manner because commands
          that operate on a working copy can use the working copy as a
          sort of <quote>staging area</quote> to set up your changes
          before committing them to the repository.  Commands that
          operate on URLs don't have this luxury, so when you operate
          directly on a URL, any of the above actions represent an
          immediate commit.</para>

    <sect2 id="svn-ch-3-sect-4.3">
      <title>Examine Your Changes</title>
      
      <para>Once you've finished making changes, you need to commit
        them to the repository, but before you do so, it's usually a
        good idea to take a look at exactly what you've changed.  By
        examining your changes before you commit, you can make a
        more accurate log message. You may also discover that
        you've inadvertently changed a file, and this gives you a
        chance to revert those changes before committing.
        Additionally, this is a good opportunity to review and
        scrutinize changes before publishing them.  You can see
        exactly what changes you've made by using <command>svn
        status</command>, <command>svn diff</command>, and
        <command>svn revert</command>.  You will usually use the first
        two commands to find out what files have changed in your
        working copy, and then perhaps the third to revert some (or
        all) of those changes.</para>
      
      <!-- pll - Fri 07 Feb 2003 12:55:07                                   -->
      <!-- I find this following paragraph a little unclear.  Mostly for    -->
      <!-- the same reasons as I found the sidebar above unclear.  There    -->
      <!-- hasn't been much discussion of the Subversion architecture, and  -->
      <!-- therefore, nothing has been clearly stated wrt the fact that the -->
      <!-- repository may not be local.                                     -->
      
      <para>Subversion has been optimized to help you with this task,
        and is able to do many things without communicating with the
        repository.  In particular, your working copy contains a
        secret cached <quote>pristine</quote> copy of each version
        controlled file within the <filename>.svn</filename> area.
        Because of this, Subversion can quickly show you how your
        working files have changed, or even allow you to undo your
        changes without contacting the repository.</para>

        <title><command>svn status</command></title>

          <title>CVS Users: Hold That Update!</title>
          
          <para>You're probably used to using <command>cvs
            update</command> to see what changes you've made to your
            working copy.  <command>svn status</command> will give you
            all the information you need regarding what has changed in
            your working copy&mdash;without accessing the repository
            or potentially incorporating new changes published by
            other users.</para>
        
          <para>In Subversion, <command>update</command> does just
            that&mdash;it updates your working copy with any changes
            committed to the repository since the last time you've
            updated your working copy.  You'll have to break the habit
            of using the <command>update</command> command to see what
            local modifications you've made.</para>

        <para>If you run <command>svn status</command> at the top of

          or directory.  If you see
          <computeroutput>A&nbsp;&nbsp;+</computeroutput>, this means
          the item is scheduled for addition-with-history.  It could be
          a file, or the root of a copied directory.
          <computeroutput>+</computeroutput>
          means the item is part of a subtree scheduled for
          addition-with-history, i.e. some parent got copied, and it's
          just coming along for the ride.
          <computeroutput>M&nbsp;&nbsp;+</computeroutput> means the item
          is part of a subtree scheduled for addition-with-history,
          <emphasis>and</emphasis> it has local modifications.  When you
          commit, first the parent will be added-with-history (copied),

          Then the local modifications will be uploaded into the
          copy.</para>

        <para>The fifth column will only show whitespace or an

          <title>Look Ma! No Network!</title>

        <para>All three of these commands (<command>svn
          status</command>, <command>svn diff</command>, and
          <command>svn revert</command>) can be used without any
          network access.  This makes it easy to manage your
          changes-in-progress when you are somewhere without a network
          connection, such as traveling on an airplane, riding a
          commuter train or hacking on the beach.</para>

        <para>Subversion does this by keeping private caches of
          pristine versions of each versioned file inside of the
          <filename>.svn</filename> administrative areas.  This allows
          Subversion to report&mdash;and revert&mdash;local
          modifications to those files <emphasis>without network
          access</emphasis>.  This cache (called the
          <quote>text-base</quote>) also allows Subversion to send the
          user's local modifications during a commit to the server as
          a compressed delta against the pristine version.  Having
          this cache is a tremendous benefit&mdash;even if you have a
          fast net connection, it's much faster to send only a file's
          changes rather than the whole file to the server.  At first
          glance, this might not seem that important, but imagine the
          repercussions if you try to commit a one line change to a
          400MB file and have to send the whole file to the
          server!</para>

      <para>We've already seen how <command>svn status -u</command>

      <para>The <computeroutput>U</computeroutput> and
        <computeroutput>G</computeroutput> codes are no cause for
        concern; those files cleanly absorbed changes from the
        repository.  The files marked with
        <computeroutput>U</computeroutput> contained no local changes
        but were <computeroutput>U</computeroutput>pdated with changes
        from the repository.  The <computeroutput>G</computeroutput>
        stands for mer<computeroutput>G</computeroutput>ed, which
        means that the file had local changes to begin with, but the
        changes coming from the repository didn't overlap in any
        way.</para>
           
      <para>But the <computeroutput>C</computeroutput> stands for

        <para>Merging conflicts by hand can be quite intimidating the
          first time you attempt it, but with a little practice, it
          can become as easy as falling off a bike.</para>

        <para>Here's an example.  Let's say that, due to a
          miscommunication between you and your collaborator, Sally,
          both edit the file named <filename>sandwich.txt</filename>
          at the same time.  Sally commits her changes, and when you
          go to update your working copy, you get a conflict and we're
          going to have to edit <filename>sandwich.txt</filename> to
          resolve the conflicts.  First, let's take a look at the
          file:</para>

        <screen>
$ cat sandwich.txt
Top piece of bread
Mayonnaise
Lettuce
Tomato
Provolone
&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; .mine
Salami

</screen>

        <para>The strings of less-than signs, equal signs, and
          greater-than signs are called <firstterm>conflict
          markers</firstterm>.  The text between the first two sets of
          markers is composed of the changes you made in the
          conflicting area:</para>

        <screen>
&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; .mine
Salami
Mortadella
Prosciutto

        <para>Whereas the text between the second and third sets of

Grilled Chicken
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; .r2
</screen>

        <para>Usually you won't want to just delete the conflict
        markers and Sally's changes&mdash;she's going to be awfully
        surprised when the sandwich arrives and it's not what she
        wanted.  So this is where you pick up the phone or walk across
        the office and explain to Sally that you can't get sauerkraut
        from an Italian deli.<footnote><para>And if you ask them for
        it, they may very well ride you out of town on a

    <title>Examining History</title>

    <para>As we mentioned earlier, the repository is like a time
      machine.  It keeps a record of every change ever committed,
      and allows you to explore this history by examining previous
      versions of files and directories as well as the metadata that
      accompanies them.  With a single Subversion command, you can
      check out the repository (or restore an existing working copy)
      exactly as it was at any date or revision number in the past.
      However, sometimes you just want to <emphasis>peer
      into</emphasis> the past instead of <emphasis>going

        If you wish to see a different range of revisions in a

      <para>You can also examine the log history of a single file or directory.

        Because Subversion allows you to move and copy files and
        directories, it is important to be able to track path changes
        in the filesystem, so in verbose mode, <command>svn
        log</command> will include a list of

          Response?</title>
        
        <para>After working with Subversion for a bit, most users will

</screen>

        <para>At first glance, this seems like an error.  But recall
          that while revisions are repository-wide, <command>svn
          log</command> operates on a path in the repository.  If you
          supply no path, Subversion uses the current working
          directory as the default target.  As a result, if you're
          operating in a subdirectory of your working copy and attempt
          to log a revision in which neither that directory nor any of
          its children was changed, Subversion will give you an empty
          log.  If you want to see what changed in that revision, try
          pointing <command>svn log</command> directly at the top-most
          URL of your repository, as in <command>svn log -r 2

      <title><command>svn cleanup</command></title>

      <para>When Subversion modifies your working copy (or any
        information within <filename>.svn</filename>), it tries to do
        so as safely as possible.  Before changing anything, it writes
        its intentions to a log file, executes the commands in the log
        file, then removes the log file (this is similar in design to
        a journaled filesystem).  If a Subversion operation is
        interrupted (if the process is killed, or if the machine
        crashes, for example), the log files remain on disk.  By
        re-executing the log files, Subversion can complete the
        previously started operation, and your working copy can get
        itself back into a consistent state.</para>

      <para>And this is exactly what <command>svn cleanup</command>
        does: it searches your working copy and runs any leftover
        logs, removing locks in the process.  If Subversion ever tells
        you that some part of your working copy is
        <quote>locked</quote>, then this is the command that you
        should run.  Also, <command>svn status</command> will display
        an <literal>L</literal> next to locked items:</para>

    <title>Summary</title>
        
      <para>Now we've covered most of the Subversion client
          commands.  Notable exceptions are those dealing with
          branching and merging (see <xref linkend="svn-ch-4"/>) and
          properties (see <xref linkend="svn-ch-7-sect-2"/>).
          However, you may want to take a moment to skim through <xref
          linkend="svn-ch-9"/> to get an idea of all the many
          different commands that Subversion has&mdash;and how you can
          use them to make your work easier.</para>
