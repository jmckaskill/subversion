Design documentation for Subversion is here.

You'll want to get 

   ftp://ftp.gnu.org/pub/gnu/texinfo/texinfo-4.0.tar.gz

and use the up-to-date `makeinfo' found therein.

JimB fixed up a lot of our Texinfo problems, here's what he says:
============================================================================

I think I've got things straightened out now.  Unfortunately, I don't
seem to have permission to check anything into the repository.  We are
working on the Tigris repository again, right?

Anyway, once I can commit things, here's the scoop:

- Info builds cleanly, so I've removed the --no-verify flag from the
  makeinfo command.  Any complains can be taken as real problems.
- The dvi builds without complains about undefined cross references.


As far as I can tell, our tools should work for us exactly as we'd
hope:

- There is no need to list next, prev, and up links in our @node
  lines.  (Certainly a critical requirement.)

- The Emacs commands can rebuild all our menus automatically and
  accurately.

- makeinfo will only complain about real problems.


The only real problem is that makeinfo's error messages are pretty
unhelpful.  It often misidentifies the error, so it's not at all
obvious how to fix a file it doesn't like.  But here are the rules we
have to follow; I found problems in each of these areas.

- @node and sectioning commands (@chapter, @section, ...) should
  always come in pairs --- the @node command on one line, and the
  sectioning command on the very next line.  This goes for the ``top''
  @node as well, which should be followed by a @top command.

- @node names must be globally unique.  This is an unfortunate
  property of info, but it's inherent in the format.  Ben had a lot of
  ``Overview'' nodes.

- @menu commands should be properly formatted.  They should look like
  this:

    @menu
    * Filesystem::
    * Server Library::
    @end menu

  Not this:

    @menu
    * Filesystem
    * Server Library
    @end menu

  If we always use C-c C-u C-a, this should just work.

- @menu commands should always list the correct nodes.

When these rules are broken, the error messages from makeinfo are
pretty unhelpful --- bordering on utterly random.  They complain that
nodes are undefined when they're perfectly clearly correct.

We should always use C-c C-u C-a (`texinfo-all-menus-update') to
reconstruct a file's menus, instead of editing the menus by hand.
That will eliminate the bottom two problems.

You can also give a prefix to C-c C-s, which tells it to list the
@node commands alongside their sectioning commands.  This is helpful
for finding mismatches.
