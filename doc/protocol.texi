@chapter Protocol

The Subversion client library @code{libsvn_ra_dav} uses the @emph{Neon}
library to generate WebDAV DeltaV requests and sends them to a
"Subversion-aware" Apache server.

This Apache server is running @emph{mod_DAV} and @emph{mod_DAV_SVN},
which translates the requests into Subversion filesystem calls.  

For more info, @xref{Network Layer}.

For a detailed description of exactly how Greg Stein
(<@email{gstein@@lyra.org}>) is mapping the WebDAV DeltaV spec to
Subversion, see his paper:  @file{notes/webdav-usage.html}

For more information on WebDAV and the DeltaV extensions, see
@uref{http://www.webdav.org} and @uref{http://www.webdav.org/deltav}.
