Goal: I want a single unified user manual, much in the spirit of the
excellent FreeBSD Handbook, probably called the "Subversion Handbook".

Like the FreeBSD Handbook, it should be compact and to-the-point, and
cover 95% of all topics that users run into.  It should explain
expected behaviors, and give short sample 'recipes'.  

Most importantly, it shouldn't be so detailed as to preclude a *real*
book, like the one Karl and Fitz writing for O'Reilly.  (Someday that
book will be included in our source tree too.)

Possible Outline of the Subversion Handbook


Preface

I. Getting Started

  1. Intro  [from the LJ article]
       a. 'revision control' system vs. 'SCM' system
       b. why svn exists
       c. overview of features

  2. Design overview
       [very quick tour of library 'layers' -- from LJ article]

  3. Installation
       [various ways of installing binary packages for different platforms]
       [pointer to appendix 3]

  4. Subversion Basics
      [put pointer to appendix 1, so CVS users can read the 'diff']
       a. The non-locking model
             [Jim's great conversational explanation]   
       b. Quick walkthrough
             [explanation of ra_local vs. ra_dav]
             [repos creation/tour/walkthrough from our README doc]


II. Client Cookbook

  1. checkout
  2. basic work cycle  
       1. making changes:  editing, rm, add, revert
       2. examining the wc:  status, info
       3. sending changes:  commit
       3. receiving changes:  update, resolve (conflicts)
  3. history:  diff/log
  4. branches and tags:  cp/switch/merge
  5. properties
      a. general use:  pl/pg/ps/pe/pd
      b. "magic" properties:  eol-style, keywords, executable
  6. modules:  svn:externals
  7. other commands:  import/export/mkdir/cleanup


III.  Repository Administration

   [run over tasks solved by 'svnadmin' and 'svnlook' features]

  1. Creating a repository
  2. Repository hooks
  3. DB maintenance
       a. Berkeley DB maintenance:  db_recover, ptrs to their site
       b. [someday SQL pointers]
  4. Repository tweaking:  undeltify, setlog, ls/rmtxns
  5. Networking the repository [httpd config]
  6. Repository migration: dump/load

IV. Appendices

  1. SVN for CVS users
  2. Compiling from source
  3. Contributing to the project
  4. Quickref sheet [can this be ported from latex?]
  5. Links:  pointers to FAQ, WebDAV docs
  6. License
