                              WARNING!!!

Subversion is still pre-alpha software and should not be used in anything 
even approaching a production environment.  The working copy and repository 
formats are almost certainly going to change in ways that are not backwards 
compatable, and Murphy's Law says that you will be the one that runs into 
the nasty bug that munges all your data in a completely non-recoverable way.  

If this hasn't scared you off yet, please use this port to download the most 
recent development code from the main Subversion repository located at 
http://svn.collab.net/repos/svn/trunk, and report any bugs you encounter to 
the development mailing list at dev@subversion.tigris.org.
