Subversion post installation notes
==================================

Some tips to get you started:
-----------------------------
* Read the documentation included with this distribution.
* For more info - Fire up your browser and point it to:
  http://subversion.tigris.org/ and look for documentation.
* You can use the mod_dav_svn.so apache module found in the distro's
  apache2\modules folder if you want to use Subversion as a server.
  You should also read the Readme.txt file (see below).
* Take a look in the Readme.txt file found in the Subversion folder and
  the start menu. It may save you some time if you get into trouble.

Notes for Windows 9x and Millenium users:
-----------------------------------------
Add this line to your Autoexec.bat file (adjust the path so it fits your
system) if it's not there:

  SET APR_ICONV_PATH="C:\Program Files\Subversion\iconv"

Restart your machine if your Autoexec.bat file are changed.
