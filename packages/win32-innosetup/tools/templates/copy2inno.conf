# Settings file for the copy2inno script
################################################################################
# Copy this file to your %APPDATA%\Subversion directory. If you already have
# done it, then skip this paragraph and continue to read from the Intro heading
# below.
#
# If you don't know your %APPDATA%\Subversion directory - or just are lazy like
# me, then run the copy2inno.bat batch file with the following parameter from a
# console window:
#    copy2inno
# copy2inno will now copy this file to your %APPDATA%\Subverson and print out
# it's pathto the console. Continue to read from the Intro heading when this
# file is copyed.
#
# Intro:
# ======
# This file contains package sections with one or more file-copy directives.
# The format is easy simple and powerful (just look at the examples below).
# Each section are just a directive which are telling copy2inno what to copy.
# A look at the commented examples should give you the picture.
#
# Format rules
# =============================================
# Each section have one or more path-root parameters and each path-root
# parameter have one or more file-copy parameters. A section let you make many
# different copy types like copying different packages from Release or Debug
# folders or variations of a package which is compiled with different compilators.
#
# file-copy usage:
#     file-copy=source -> innosetup_sub_folder
#
# * The source part can have wildcards (? and *) or Perl regular expressions.
# * The -> separates the source and innosetup_sub_folder. The reason of using
#   -> in stead of a space is that then we don't have to bother to surround a 
# * The innosetup_sub_folder is under the subversion's sources
#   package\win32-innosetup folder. This is the place where Inno Setup will
#   compile the sources from.
#
# Some examples:
# * Copy only files who ends with .exe and .dll:
#     file-copy=*.exe -> in\app\subversion
#	  file-copy=*.dll -> in\app\berkeley
#   Or you can use one line of a regular expression:
#     file-copy=/.*(\.dll|\.exe)$/ -> in\subversion
# * Copy only foo.exe, bar.exe and foo.dll:
#     file-copy=/(foo|bar)\.exe|foo.dll/ -> in\subversion
# * Copy everything but files who ends with the .obj extention:
#     file-copy=! /.*\.obj$/ in\subversion
#
# Now, just edit/add/delete/study and use the samples below, then you will be
# ready to have this system up within 10 to 20 minutes.
# The indention of the lines below is not required but you should use it for
# your own sanity :-). As you might have noticed, comments are legal too as
# long as a line starts with a #
# Good luck!
