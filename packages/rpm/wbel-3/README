                              RPM GENERATION


This directory contains the scripts necessary and sufficient
to build the subversion*.i386.rpm and subversion*.src.rpm files as a
non-root user in the user's home (rpms) directory.

This build requires certain other packages to be installed.

1.  Requirements

    *** Note: apache now also contains apr and apr-util packages.

    A. To run:

       See the "Requires:" lines in the subversion.spec file.

    B. To compile:

       See the "PreReq:" lines in the subversion.spec file.

    The non-standard packages apache, db, and neon, can be found at:

    http://summersoft.fay.ar.us/pub/subversion/latest

2.  Building a source and binary RPM

    To build the latest release directly from the subversion repository:

    $ cd ../..; svn update; cd packages/rpm/redhat-7.x; make
      or
    $ cd ../..; svn update; cd packages/rpm/redhat-8+; make

    To make a particular release:

    $ cd ../..; svn update -r <ReleaseNumber>; cd packages/rpm/redhat-7.x; make
      or   
    $ cd ../..; svn update -r <ReleaseNumber>; cd packages/rpm/redhat-u+; make

If you have any questions or problems, please direct them to the
dev@subversion.tigris.org mailing list.  I'm on that list and will help out
if I can.

You can find the current required packages in a Subversion source repository
at the http://summersoft.fay.ar.us/repos URL.
