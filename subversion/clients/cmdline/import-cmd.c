   * What is the nicest behavior for import, from the user's point of
   * view?  This is a subtle question.  Seemingly intuitive answers
   * can lead to weird situations, such never being able to create
   * non-directories in the top-level of the repository.
   *
   * For now, let's keep things simple:
   *
   * If the third arg is present, it is the name of the new entry in
   * the repository target dir (the latter may or may not be the root
   * dir).  If it is absent, then the import happens directly in the
   * repository target dir, creating however many new entries are
   * necessary.
   *
   * If the second arg is also omitted, then "." is implied.
   *
   * The first arg cannot be omitted, of course.
   *
   * ### kff todo: review above behaviors.
