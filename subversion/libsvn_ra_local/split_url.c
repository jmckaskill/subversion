    Note that, at least on WinNT and above,  file:////./X:/path  will
    also work, so we must make sure the transformation doesn't break
    that, and  file:///path  (that looks within the current drive
    only) should also keep working.
    If we got a non-empty hostname other than localhost, we convert this
    into an UNC path.  In this case, we obviously don't strip the slash
    even if the path looks like it starts with a drive letter.
    Another thing to remember is that the form file:///\machine/share
    was the only way to access UNC paths in svn before 1.2.  We
    need to support that for compatibility with old working copies.
