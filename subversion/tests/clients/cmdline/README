            Test suite for the command line client.
            =======================================

The cmdline client test suite doesn't use the C-level testing
framework, but is structured similarly.  Instead of testing library
APIs, it drives the client just like a user would, examining the
output and the on-disk results (i.e., the working copy) carefully as
it goes.  Python is the chosen scripting language.

Automated Test Verification
---------------------------

The point of this test system is that it's *automated*:  that is, each
test can algoritmically verify the results and indicate "PASS" or
"FAIL". 

We've identified two broad classes of verification:

  1.  Verifying svn subcommand output.

      Most important subcommands (co, up, ci, im, st) print results to
      stdout as a list of paths.  Even though the paths may be printed
      out in an unpredicable order, we still want to make sure this
      list is exactly the *set* of lines we expect to get.

  2.  Verifying the working copy itself.

      Every time a subcommand could potentially change something on
      disk, we need to inspect the disk.  Specifically, this means:

         * user-data:  we need to make sure the working copy has
           exactly the tree-structure we expect, and each file has
           exactly the contents we expect.  We also need to look at
           all user-specified properties.

         * metadata:  we need to examine all the 'entries' files.


The General Solution:  Trees
----------------------------

Sam TH <sam@uchicago.edu> proposed and began work on a solution
whereby all important, inspectable information is parsed into a
general, in-memory tree representation.

By comparing actual vs. expected tree structures, we get automated
verification.


Specific Tree Solutions
-----------------------

Each node in our generic trees have these fields:

  - name :  the name of the node  (the basename of the path)
  - children:  list of child nodes (if the node is a dir)
  - contents:  textual contents (if the node is a file)
  - properties:  a hash to hold subversion props (on files or dirs)
  - atts:        a hash of meta-information about tree nodes themselves

  * subcommand output

    svntest.tree.* provides functions to parse commandline output into
    a tree.  meta-information in stored in each treenode's `atts' hash:

         checkout/update:  a 'status' attribute is set to a two-character
                           value (from the set (A, D, G, U, C, _, ' '))

         status:           a 'status' attribute (as above), plus two props
                           to hold the WC and Repos revision numbers.

         commit/import:    a 'verb' attribute is set to one of
                           (Adding, Changing, Deleting)

   * disk verification

     svntest.tree.* also has routines that walk a regular working copy
     and returns a tree representing disk contents and props.

   * `entries' files:  ### TODO

       We need a function that can assemble all the 'entries' files
       into a tree.  The 'contents' and 'props' fields can be ignored;
       xml attributes can be directly copied into our tree nodes'
       `atts' hashes.

>>> Running a test script

   *  Just run the script, and all of its tests will execute:

              ./basic_tests.py

   *  To see a list of tests within a script:

              ./basic_tests.py list

   *  To run a specific test within a script, specify its number:

              ./basic_tests.py 7


>>> To make a script run over ra_DAV instead of ra_local: 

   * because repositories are still created on-the-fly (which httpd
     must read), the client and server must still running on the
     -same- machine.

   * use global switch to python test scripts:  '--url'

               ./basic_tests.py --url http://localhost
               ./basic_tests.py 3 --url http://newton.collab.net

     ASSUMPTIONS MADE BY THIS MODE:

       - an svn-aware httpd is running locally on port 80.

       - httpd.conf has a DAV Location '/repositories/current-repo'
         that maps to the 'repositories/current-repo' symlink right
         below these tests.

       - httpd.conf has a DAV Location '/local_tmp/repos' that maps to
         the master 'local_tmp/repos' right below these tests.
