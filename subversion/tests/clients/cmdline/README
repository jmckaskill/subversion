            Test suite for the command line client.
            =======================================

Currently, the command line client lives in ../../../client/, for
historical reasons, and is the only testable Subversion client.
Eventually, though, it will live in ../../../clients/cmdline/, and be
one of many clients; that's why the test dir is tests/clients/cmdline/
instead of tests/client/.

The cmdline client test suite doesn't use the C-level testing
framework.  Instead, it drives the client just like a user would,
examining the output and the on-disk results (i.e., the working copy)
carefully as it goes.

The files in this directory:
 
 * svn_test_main.py:      main test framework.
                          exports client_test(), which runs a list of 
                             provided tests.

 * example_tests1.py:     template test program.
                          demonstrates how to write tests and then
                             call svn_test_main.client_test() on them.

 * svn_entry.py:          parser for subversion's 'entries' file.

 * svn_output.py:         parser for various line-oriented outputs of 
                            of the svn command-line client.

 * xml_tests.py:          set of tests for doing client operations to/from XML.
