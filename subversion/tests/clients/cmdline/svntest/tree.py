#========================================================================

# ===>  Overview of our Datastructures  <===

# The general idea here is that many, many things can be represented by
# a tree structure:

#   - a working copy's structure and contents
#   - the output of 'svn status'
#   - the output of 'svn checkout/update'
#   - the output of 'svn commit'

# The idea is that a test function creates a "expected" tree of some
# kind, and is then able to compare it to an "actual" tree that comes
# from running the Subversion client.  This is what makes a test
# automated; if an actual and expected tree match exactly, then the test
# has passed.  (See compare_trees() below.)

# The SVNTreeNode class is the fundamental data type used to build tree
# structures.  The class contains a method for "dropping" a new node
# into an ever-growing tree structure. (See also create_from_path()).

# We have four parsers in this file for the four use cases listed above:
# each parser examines some kind of input and returns a tree of
# SVNTreeNode objects.  (See build_tree_from_checkout(),
# build_tree_from_commit(), build_tree_from_status(), and
# build_tree_from_wc()).  These trees are the "actual" trees that result
# from running the Subversion client.

# Also necessary, of course, is a convenient way for a test to create an
# "expected" tree.  The test *could* manually construct and link a bunch
# of SVNTreeNodes, certainly.  But instead, all the tests are using the
# build_generic_tree() routine instead.

# build_generic_tree() takes a specially-formatted list of lists as
# input, and returns a tree of SVNTreeNodes.  The list of lists has this
# structure:

#   [ ['/full/path/to/item', 'text contents', {prop-hash}, {att-hash}],
#     [...],
#     [...],
#     ...   ]

# You can see that each item in the list essentially defines an
# SVNTreeNode.  build_generic_tree() instantiates a SVNTreeNode for each
# item, and then drops it into a tree by parsing each item's full path.

# So a typical test routine spends most of its time preparing lists of
# this format and sending them to build_generic_tree(), rather than
# building the "expected" trees directly.

#   ### Note: in the future, we'd like to remove this extra layer of
#   ### abstraction.  We'd like the SVNTreeNode class to be more
#   ### directly programmer-friendly, providing a number of accessor
#   ### routines, so that tests can construct trees directly.

# The first three fields of each list-item are self-explanatory.  It's
# the fourth field, the "attribute" hash, that needs some explanation.
# The att-hash is used to place extra information about the node itself,
# depending on the parsing context:

#   - in the 'svn co/up' use-case, each line of output starts with two
#     characters from the set of (A, D, G, U, C, _) or 'Restored'.  The
#     status code is stored in a attribute named 'status'.  In the case
#     of a restored file, the word 'Restored' is stored in an attribute
#     named 'verb'.

#   - in the 'svn ci/im' use-case, each line of output starts with one
#      of the words (Adding, Deleting, Sending).  This verb is stored in
#      an attribute named 'verb'.

#   - in the 'svn status' use-case (which is always run with the -v
#     (--verbose) flag), each line of output contains a working revision
#     number and a two-letter status code similar to the 'svn co/up'
#     case.  This information is stored in attributes named 'wc_rev'
#     and 'status'.  The repository revision is also printed, but it
#     is ignored.

#   - in the working-copy use-case, the att-hash is ignored.


# Finally, one last explanation: the file 'actions.py' contain a number
# of helper routines named 'run_and_verify_FOO'.  These routines take
# one or more "expected" trees as input, then run some svn subcommand,
# then push the output through an appropriate parser to derive an
# "actual" tree.  Then it runs compare_trees() and raises an exception
# on failure.  This is why most tests typically end with a call to
# run_and_verify_FOO().
