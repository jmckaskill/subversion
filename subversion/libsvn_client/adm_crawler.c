/* Public interface.

   Do a depth-first crawl of the local changes in a working copy,
   beginning at ROOT_DIRECTORY.  Push synthesized xml (representing a
   coherent tree-delta) at XML_PARSER.

   Presumably, the client library will grab a "walker" from libsvn_ra,
   build an svn_xml_parser_t around it, and then pass the parser to
   this routine.  This is how local changes in the working copy are
   ultimately translated into network requests.  */
