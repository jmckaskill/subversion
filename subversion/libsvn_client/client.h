/*** Commit Stuff ***/

/* WARNING: This is all new, untested, un-peer-reviewed conceptual
   stuff.

   The day that 'svn switch' came into existence, our old commit
   crawler (svn_wc_crawl_local_mods) became obsolete.  It relied far
   too heavily on the on-disk heirarchy of files and directories, and
   simply had no way to support disjoint working copy trees or nest
   working copies.  The primary reason for this is that commit
   process, in order to guarantee atomicity, is a single drive of a
   commit editor which is based not on working copy paths, but on
   URLs.  With the completion of 'svn switch', it became all too
   likely that the on-disk working copy heirarchy would no longer be
   guaranteed to map to a similar in-repository heirarchy.

   Aside from this new brokenness of the old system, an unrelated
   feature request had cropped up -- the ability to know in advance of
   your commit, exactly what would be committed (so that log messages
   could be initially populated with this information).  Since the old
   crawler discovered commit candidates while in the process of
   committing, it was impossible to harvest this information upfront.
   As a workaround, svn_wc_statuses() was used to stat the whole
   working copy for changes before the commit started...and then the
   commit would again stat the whole tree for changes.

   Enter the new system.

   The primary goal of this system is very straightforward: harvest
   all commit candidate information up front, and cache enough info in
   the process to use this to drive a URL-sorted commit.

   *** END-OF-KNOWLEDGE ***

   The prototypes below are still in development.  In general, the
   idea is that commit-y processes ('svn mkdir URL', 'svn delete URL',
   'svn commit', 'svn copy WC_PATH URL', 'svn copy URL1 URL2', 'svn
   move URL1 URL2', others?) generate the cached commit candidate
   information, and hand this information off to a consumer which is
   responsible for driving the RA layer's commit editor in a
   URL-depth-first fashion and reporting back the post-commit
   information.

/* Recursively crawl a set of working copy paths (PARENT_DIR + each
   item in the TARGETS array) looking for commit candidates, locking
   working copy directories as the crawl progresses.  For each
   candidate found:

     - create svn_client_commit_item_t for the candidate.

     - add the structure to an apr_array_header_t array of commit
       items that are in the same repository, creating a new array if
       necessary.

     - add (or update) a reference to this array to the COMMITTABLES
       hash, keyed on the canonical repository name.  ### todo, until
       multi-repository support actually exists, the single key here
       will actually be some arbitrary thing to be ignored.  

     - if the candidate has a lock token, add it to the LOCK_TOKENS hash.

     - if the candidate is a directory scheduled for deletion, crawl
       the directories children recursively for any lock tokens and
       add them to the LOCK_TOKENS array.

   At the successful return of this function, COMMITTABLES will be an
   apr_hash_t * hash of apr_array_header_t * arrays (of
   svn_client_commit_item_t * structures), keyed on const char *
   canonical repository URLs.  LOCK_TOKENS will point to a hash table
   with const char * lock tokens, keyed on const char * URLs.  Also,
   LOCKED_DIRS will be an apr_hash_t * hash of svn_wc_adm_access_t *
   keyed
   on const char * working copy path directory names which were locked
   in the process of this crawl.  These will need to be unlocked again post-commit.

   If NONRECURSIVE is specified, subdirectories of directory targets
   found in TARGETS will not be crawled for modifications.

   If JUST_LOCKED is TRUE, treat unmodified items with lock tokens as
   commit candidates.

   If CTX->CANCEL_FUNC is non-null, it will be called with 
   CTX->CANCEL_BATON while harvesting to determine if the client has
