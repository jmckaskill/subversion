/*** Commit Stuff ***/

/* WARNING: This is all new, untested, un-peer-reviewed conceptual
   stuff.

   The day that 'svn switch' came into existence, our old commit
   crawler (svn_wc_crawl_local_mods) became obsolete.  It relied far
   too heavily on the on-disk hierarchy of files and directories, and
   simply had no way to support disjoint working copy trees or nest
   working copies.  The primary reason for this is that commit
   process, in order to guarantee atomicity, is a single drive of a
   commit editor which is based not on working copy paths, but on
   URLs.  With the completion of 'svn switch', it became all too
   likely that the on-disk working copy hierarchy would no longer be
   guaranteed to map to a similar in-repository hierarchy.

   Aside from this new brokenness of the old system, an unrelated
   feature request had cropped up -- the ability to know in advance of
   your commit, exactly what would be committed (so that log messages
   could be initially populated with this information).  Since the old
   crawler discovered commit candidates while in the process of
   committing, it was impossible to harvest this information upfront.
   As a workaround, svn_wc_statuses() was used to stat the whole
   working copy for changes before the commit started...and then the
   commit would again stat the whole tree for changes.

   Enter the new system.

   The primary goal of this system is very straightforward: harvest
   all commit candidate information up front, and cache enough info in
   the process to use this to drive a URL-sorted commit.

   *** END-OF-KNOWLEDGE ***

   The prototypes below are still in development.  In general, the
   idea is that commit-y processes ('svn mkdir URL', 'svn delete URL',
   'svn commit', 'svn copy WC_PATH URL', 'svn copy URL1 URL2', 'svn
   move URL1 URL2', others?) generate the cached commit candidate
   information, and hand this information off to a consumer which is
   responsible for driving the RA layer's commit editor in a
   URL-depth-first fashion and reporting back the post-commit
   information.

*/



/* ### This is TEMPORARY! Until we can find out the canonical
   repository URL of a given entry, we'll just use this bogus value in

   repository URLs anyway, so this will go away and the real URLs will
   be the keys of the committables hash. */

/* Recursively crawl a set of working copy paths (PARENT_DIR + each

   candidate found:

     - create svn_client_commit_item_t for the candidate.

     - add the structure to an apr_array_header_t array of commit
       items that are in the same repository, creating a new array if
       necessary.

     - add (or update) a reference to this array to the COMMITTABLES
       hash, keyed on the canonical repository name.  ### todo, until
       multi-repository support actually exists, the single key here
       will actually be some arbitrary thing to be ignored.

     - if the candidate has a lock token, add it to the LOCK_TOKENS hash.

     - if the candidate is a directory scheduled for deletion, crawl
       the directories children recursively for any lock tokens and
       add them to the LOCK_TOKENS array.

   unlocked again post-commit.

   for svn_client_commit4().

   commit candidates.

/*** Externals (Modules) ***/

/* Handle changes to the svn:externals property in the tree traversed
   by TRAVERSAL_INFO (obtained from svn_wc_get_update_editor or
   svn_wc_get_switch_editor, for example).  The tree's top level
   directory is at TO_PATH and corresponds to FROM_URL URL in the
   repository, which has a root URL of REPOS_ROOT_URL.

   For each changed value of the property, discover the nature of the
   change and behave appropriately -- either check a new "external"
   subdir, or call svn_wc_remove_from_revision_control() on an
   existing one, or both.

   REQUESTED_DEPTH is the requested depth of the driving operation
   (e.g., update, switch, etc).  If it is neither svn_depth_infinity
   nor svn_depth_unknown, then changes to svn:externals will have no
   effect.  If REQUESTED_DEPTH is svn_depth_unknown, then the ambient
   depth of each working copy directory holding an svn:externals value
   will determine whether that value is interpreted there (the ambient
   depth must be svn_depth_infinity).  If REQUESTED_DEPTH is
   svn_depth_infinity, then it is presumed to be expanding any
   shallower ambient depth, so changes to svn:externals values will be
   interpreted.

   Pass NOTIFY_FUNC with NOTIFY_BATON along to svn_client_checkout().

   ### todo: AUTH_BATON may not be so useful.  It's almost like we
       need access to the original auth-obtaining callbacks that
       produced auth baton in the first place.  Hmmm. ###

   If UPDATE_UNCHANGED, then run svn_client_update() on any external
   items that are the same in both the before and after traversal
   info.

   *TIMESTAMP_SLEEP will be set TRUE if a sleep is required to ensure
   timestamp integrity, *TIMESTAMP_SLEEP will be unchanged if no sleep
   is required.

   Use POOL for temporary allocation. */
