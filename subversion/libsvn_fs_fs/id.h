/* Node Revision IDs.

   Within the database, we refer to nodes and node revisions using strings
   of numbers separated by periods that look a lot like RCS revision
   numbers.

              node_id ::= number ;
              copy_id ::= number ;
               txn_id ::= number ;
                  rev ::= number ;
               offset ::= number ;
     node_revision_id ::= node_id "." copy_id "." txn_id "." rev "." offset;

   A directory entry identifies the file or subdirectory it refers to
   using a node revision number --- not a node number.  This means that
   a change to a file far down in a directory hierarchy requires the
   parent directory of the changed node to be updated, to hold the new
   node revision ID.  Now, since that parent directory has changed, its
   parent needs to be updated.

   If a particular subtree was unaffected by a given commit, the node
   revision ID that appears in its parent will be unchanged.  When
   doing an update, we can notice this, and ignore that entire
   subtree.  This makes it efficient to find localized changes in
   large trees.  */
