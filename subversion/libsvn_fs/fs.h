  /* A kludge for handling errors noticed by APR pool cleanup functions.

     The APR pool cleanup functions can only return an apr_status_t
     value, not a full svn_error_t value.  This makes it difficult to
     propagate errors detected by fs_cleanup to someone who can handle
     them.

     If FS->cleanup_error is non-zero, it points to a location where
     fs_cleanup should store a pointer to an svn_error_t object, if it
     generates one.  Normally, it's zero, but if the cleanup is
     invoked by code prepared to deal with an svn_error_t object in
     some helpful way, it can create its own svn_error_t *, set it to
     zero, set cleanup_error to point to it, free the pool (thus
     invoking the cleanup), and then check its svn_error_t to see if
     anything went wrong.

     Of course, if multiple errors occur, this will only report one of
     them, but it's better than nothing.  In the case of a cascade,
     the first error message is probably the most helpful, so
     fs_cleanup won't overwrite a pointer to an existing svn_error_t
     if it finds one.  */
