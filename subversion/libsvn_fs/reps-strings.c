/*** Reading the contents from a representation. ***/

/* The fulltext reconstruction code has its weak spot isolated to one
 * case in the function window_handler().  By improving that case, we
 * asymptotically approach having a real delta combiner; for now, it's
 * just the naive reconstruction method.
 *
 * Here's an overview:
 *
 * rep_read_range() runs through the raw svndiff data, passing it into
 * a stream which invokes window_handler() every time a new window is
 * available.  The window_handler() ignores windows until it sees one
 * that reconstructs data within the range requested, at which point
 * it
 *
 *     1. obtains the range of source fulltext used by this window in
 *        reconstructing whatever portion the requested target range,
 *        by naively making a recursive call to rep_read_range(),
 *
 *   or
 *
 *     2. looks at the source rep; if it's a fulltext, does a dance
 *        for joy and grabs the relevant range, else if it's a delta,
 *        starts reading windows and reconstructs on the fly --
 *        wherever, this new window stream itself needs source data,
 *        it starts reading windows, and so on...
 *
 * [Got this up and running using #1, next task is to switch to #2.]
 *
 * When window_handler() has finished reconstructing the requested
 * range, or receives the null window, it sets the `done' bit in its
 * baton, so that rep_read_range() won't bother looping over the
 * trailing svndiff data.
 * 
 * We won't bother to evaluate plan #1; its weaknesses are well-known,
 * although it'll probably perform acceptably for a while.
 *
 * Let's assume we've finished implementing plan #2.  How does it
 * perform?  In terms of number of passes over ignored leading svndiff
 * data, its worst case is probably Subversion's most common case,
 * that is, looping to read a whole file from beginning to end.  But
 * note that the case is only bad when each loop reads a chunk that is
 * small relative to the full size of the file.  If you use big
 * chunks, the penalty is not so bad; and if you read the whole file
 * in one call, then there's no penalty at all (except, of course,
 * that you held a whole file in memory, which your mother taught you
 * never to do).  Users of the FS interface should use their
 * judgement; probably it would be good to read a whole file at a time
 * on checkouts, for example, except when a file is really
 * prohibitively large.

/* Function of type `svn_txdelta_window_handler_t';
   BATON is a `struct window_handler_baton_t'.

   If BATON->done is set, do nothing and return immediately.
   Otherwise...

   If WINDOW is relevant, reconstruct some portion of BATON->buf, as
   part of BATON->trail; any temporary allocation happens in
   BATON->pool, which may be cleared before the handler exits.  If
   WINDOW is irrelevant, ignore it and return.

   Q: When is WINDOW irrelevant?

   A: If the range (BATON->req_offset + BATON->len_req) does not
      overlap with the range (WINDOW->tview_len + BATON->cur_offset),
      then the window is irrelevant, so: If the former range lies
      before the latter, then increment BATON->cur_offset by
      WINDOW->tview_len, else if the former range lies after the
      latter, set BATON->done to 1, and then return in either case.

      If the ranges do overlap, then the window is relevant -- that
      is, it reconstructs some or all of the requested content range,
      BATON->req_offset + BATON->len_req, so read on...

   Q: Okay, so what exactly happens when WINDOW is relevant?

   A: In that case, the data reconstructed by this window is stored at
      BATON->buf + BATON->len_read, and BATON->len_read is incremented
      by the number of bytes reconstructed, and BATON->cur_offset is
      incremented by the same amount.

      BATON->base_rep may be used to obtain source text against which
      to reconstruct.

    /* Q: Why is there a target buf allocated inside this function?
          Why not just use the output buffer directly?

       A: A given window (say, the current one) contains all the data
          necessary to reproduce a contiguous range of bytes.  If that
          range of bytes is entirely outside the range the caller
          requested, the window is ignored.  If, however, any overlap
          occurs between the window's "target view" and the requested
          range, this window must be processed.  When considering
          overlap, we have exactly one of the following situations:

             1. target window and requested range have the same
                starting offset.

             2. target window starting offset is greater than the
                starting offset of the requested range.

             3. target window starting offset is less than the
                starting offset of the requested range.

          Case 1 and Case 2 and fairly simple to deal with.  Case 1 is
          super-trivial.  Case 2 can be treated like a special Case 1
          because the "overlapped" portion came from a previous window(s).

          Case 3 is the weird one.  In this case, we have some amount
          of data coming out of the window op handling that needs to
          be discarded before we actually get to data that we care
          about.  Now, one might be tempted to just literally discard
          that data, and then actually begin writing to the output
          buffer at the proper time.  This would be fine if the only
          op types were svn_txdelta_source (which reads from a source
          buffer) and svn_txdelta_new (which reads from a "new data"
          buffer).  But the svn_txdelta_target op also exists, and it
          reads from the target buffer.  With this op type comes the
          risk that we will be asked to read from an offset that
          exists in the "overlap" region -- which we just discarded!

          So, in order to safeguard against the svn_txdelta_target op
          making requests for data which we no longer have, we need to
          "play out" this window into a temporary buffer, then copy
          the range requested by the caller into the output buffer
          once we're finished.
