This readme covers the mzscheme bindings for subversion, bindings are also 
available for stalin scheme (see subversion/bindings/stalin).

1) Building the bindings
	The bindings can be built in the top directory by running
		make siwg-mzscm
	You may also wish to run the (limmited) tests provided
		make test-swig-mzscm

2) Using the bindings
	Since scheme is a functional language, and subversion is written in c 
there are some akwardnesses.

Dealing with structs is one of those points.You can create a new struct by 
calling
	new-[structname]
	Then you can use the get/set methods to update and read the values of 
elements in the struct
	[structname]-[structcomponent]-[get or set]

	You can import all of the subversion bindings by including
		./libsvn_swig_mzscheme/svn.scm
	Or if you just wish to use on component
		(load-extension "extension.so")

Here is a listing of all of the global functions provided by the subversion 
mzscheme bindings:
