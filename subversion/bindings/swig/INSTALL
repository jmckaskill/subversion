BUILDING SWIG BINDINGS FOR SVN


Step 1:  Build & install the proper version of SWIG (which is
         currently swig 1.3.14 or greater).

    * Go to http://www.swig.org, download the sourceball, unpack.

    * In the SWIG-X.X.X directory, run ./configure.

       If you plan to build the python bindings, and have a system
       with more than one version of python installed, you may need
       to pass

             --with-python=/path/to/correct/python/binary
 
       to the configure script.  You certainly don't want to use any
       version of python older than 2.0.

    * run 'make && make install'

    * To verify you have the goodz installed, check that these things
      were created, assuming your $PREFIX was /usr/local/lib:

           - /usr/local/lib/swig1.3/*.i
           - /usr/local/lib/libswig*.so
           - /usr/local/bin/swig


Step 2:  Build Subversion.

  See Subversion's own INSTALL file for details.

  Make sure that Subversion's ./configure script sees your installed SWIG!
  It tries to detect SWIG near the very end of its output.



SPECIFIC LANGUAGE BINDINGS


*  Python

   1.  cd subversion/bindings/swig/python

   2.  python setup.py build

       Note that the 'setup.py' script has some hardcoded paths at the
       top; you might need to edit them so that your installed svn
       libraries and headers can be found.

   3.  python setup.py install [--prefix PREFIX]

       If you specified '--with-prefix' to subversion's configure
       script, you'll need to use it again here.

   4.  Verify that an 'svn' package has been created.  It should be
       sitting right in the current directory:  a subdir containing
       .py files and an __init__.py.  Also verify that the package was
       installed to a public area.  (For example, some place like
       /usr/local/lib/python2.2/site-packages/svn)

   5.  Try some demo programs.  From the top of your svn working copy,
       cd tools/examples/, and try running 'svnlook.py'.



*  Java?


*  Perl?
