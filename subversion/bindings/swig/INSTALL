BUILDING SWIG BINDINGS FOR SVN


Step 1:  Build & install the proper version of SWIG (which is
         currently swig 1.3.16).

    * Go to http://www.swig.org/, download the sourceball, unpack.

    * In the SWIG-X.X.X directory, run ./configure.

       If you plan to build the python bindings, and have a system
       with more than one version of python installed, you may need
       to pass

             --with-python=/path/to/correct/python/binary
 
       to the configure script.  You certainly don't want to use any
       version of python older than 2.0.

    * run 'make && make install'

    * To verify you have the goodz installed, check that these things
      were created, assuming your $PREFIX was /usr/local/lib:

           - /usr/local/lib/swig1.3/*.i
           - /usr/local/lib/libswig*.so
           - /usr/local/bin/swig

      In particular, you want to make sure that libswig_py.so was
      built and installed, since the python bindings are the most-used
      ones at the moment.


Step 2:  Build and Install Subversion.

  See Subversion's own INSTALL file for details.

  Make sure that Subversion's ./configure script sees your installed SWIG!
  It tries to detect SWIG near the very end of its output.

  If Subversion's ./configure finds a SWIG that it's happy with, then
  it will build a special glue library to link svn to the swig-python
  bindings:  libsvn_swig_py.so (as well as any other languages).


SPECIFIC LANGUAGE BINDINGS


*  Python

   1.  On Unix systems, run 'make swig-py' from the top of the
       Subversion source tree.  This will invoke SWIG on the *.i
       files, resulting in a collection of .c source files.  It will
       then compile and link those .c files into Python libraries.

       On Windows, ???

   2.  On Unix systems, run 'make install-swig-py' (as root, typically)
       from the top of the Subversion source tree.  This will copy
       your new Python libraries into the appropriate system location.

       Note: If you don't have access to install to python's site-packages
       directory, you can have the python modules install to your home
       directory.  You can do this by running
       'make install-swig-py swig_pydir=~'.

       Note: If you want to install to an alternate prefix (usually only
       if you are building packages), you can supply the prefix here.  An
       example of doing this for building rpms looks like
       'make install-swig-py DESTDIR=$RPM_BUILD_ROOT/usr'.

       On Windows, ???

   3.  Verify that an 'svn' package has been installed correctly.  You can
       do this by running python via 'python -c "from svn import client"'.

   4.  Make sure that whatever directory the bindings got installed in
       is in your PYTHONPATH.  That directory depends on how you
       installed; a typical location is /usr/local/lib/svn-python/,
       see http://subversion.tigris.org/issues/show_bug.cgi?id=1125
       for some imminent improvements to the install process.

   5.  Try some demo programs.  From the top of your svn working copy,
       cd tools/examples/, and try running 'svnlook.py'.



*  Java

   The Java bindings are still under development, and have not yet
   reached a functional state.  You can attempt to build them by
   running 'make swig-java' from the top level of the Subversion
   source tree.


*  Perl?
