=head1 NAME

SVN::Client - Subversion client functions

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    require SVN::Core;
    require SVN::Client;
    my $ctx = SVN::_Client::new_svn_client_ctx_t ();

    $ctx->auth_baton (SVN::Core::auth_open
          ([SVN::Client::get_simple_provider(),
            SVN::Client::get_username_provider()]));

    SVN::Client::cat (\*STDOUT,
                      'http://svn.collab.net/repos/svn/trunk/README',
                      'HEAD', $ctx);

=head1 DESCRIPTION

SVN::Client wraps the highest level of functions provided by
subversion to accomplish specific tasks. Consult the svn_client.h
section in the Subversion API. the svn_client_ctx_t object could be
obtained as showed above in SYNOPSIS.

The author does not have much incentive to support SVN::Client, since
the behavior is really just like what you can get from the
command-line client - svn.
