Alexander Mueller <Alexander.Mueller@littleblue.de> is working on JNI
bindings for the Subversion libraries here; please mail
dev at subversion dot tigris org if you'd like to help out.

Some notes from me (Alexander) for people who 
want to play a bit with the stuff:
- take a look at the required tools list below
- try to build the java classes with "build-java.sh"
- try to build the library with "build.sh"
- try to run the tests with "run-tests.sh"

Required tools:
the java subversion binding is still in a very early
stage of development. So the easiest way to make
the library and tests compile is to have all the
tools at hand i was using:
- linux (i am using SuSE 7.2)
- gcc (i subversion gets built it should be ok)
- JUnit 3.7 (get it at www.junit.org)
- Sun Java J2SE 1.3.1
- a working subversion installation
