This Software should compile and run under win32 and linux. The next
step will be the integration into Subversion's build system.

It will produce libsvnjavahl.so or libsvnjavahl.dll (the native
library for Unix or win32, respectively) and svnjavahl.jar (platform
independent archive of Java bytecode).


On Linux it needs automake 1.6. Earlier version do not work.

Unix build tools:

$ ./autogen.sh
$ ./configure --with-jdk=<path to jdk> 

For the various other parameters to configure please see the
documentation of configure.  Requires jdk 1.2 or newer. It must be
either in the path or passed with the --with-jdk switch.  This
version of svn-up has been built with svn-revision 6062. Other
revisions may work, but are not supported.

$ make

compilation on make install

Installation dir and other configuration parameters are documented
in the configure command default installation would be in
/usr/local/bin and /usr/local/lib.


Windows:

You need the bin directory of the JDK (>= 1.2) in your path.

In subdirectory native there is a Visual Studio Project javahl.dsw
It has been developed with Visual Studio Version 6

Open this and start a build.

This creates the svnjavahl.dll library in the debug/release
subdirectory.
