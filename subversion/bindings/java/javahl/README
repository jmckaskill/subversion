This Software should compile and run under win32 and linux. The next step will be 
the integration into the subversion build system.




./autogen.sh
./configure --with-jdk=<path to jdk> 

	# For the various other parameters to configure please see the documentation of configure.
	# Requires jdk 1.2 or newer. It must bei either in the path or passed with the --with-jdk switch.
	# This version of svn-up has been built with svn-revision 6062. Other may work, but 
	# we can not guarantee it.

make

compilation on make install

Windows:

You need the bin directory of the JDK (>= 1.2) in your path.

In subdirectory native there is a Visual Studio Project javahl.dsw
It has been developed with Visual Studio Version 6

Open this and start a build.

This creates the svnjavahl.dll library in the debug/release subdirectory
