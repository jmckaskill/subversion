The present bindings generator was written after spending too much time makeing them by hand. 
It relies on ctags to correctly parse the subversion code (which it probbly does not). 
If it proves to not be workable a possible replacement is writing an emacs lisp script that 
uses cedet or similar to parse the source files.
