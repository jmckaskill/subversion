 PSEUDOCODE:

  read file1 into buf1;
  read file2 into buf2;

  slide along buf1 a char at a time, recording 4-byte strings in hash;
  slide along buf2 a char at a time, checking for matches against buf1;
     if no match, output an INSERT and record in hash
     if match, extend it as far as can, then output a COPY and bump pos
  
               okay, time to sleep
