 *
 * The name will include as much of @a path as possible, then a dot,
 * then a random portion, then another dot, then an iterated attempt
 * number (00001 for the first try, 00002 for the second, etc), and
 * end with @a suffix.  For example, if @a path is

 * there because someday, someone will have a directory full of files
 * whose names match the iterating portion and suffix (say, a
 * database's holding area).  The random portion is a safeguard
