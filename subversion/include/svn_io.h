/* Generic byte-streams */

/* svn_stream_t represents an abstract stream of bytes--either
   incoming or outgoing or both.

   The creator of a stream sets functions to handle read and write.
   Both of these handlers accept a baton whose value is determined at
   stream creation time; this baton can point to a structure
   containing data associated with the stream.  If a caller attempts
   to invoke a handler which has not been set, it will generate a
   runtime assertion failure.  The creator can also set a handler for
   close requests so that it can flush buffered data or whatever;
   if a close handler is not specified, a close request on the stream
   will simply be ignored.  Note that svn_stream_close() does not
   deallocate the memory used to allocate the stream structure; free
   the pool you created the stream in to free that memory.

   The read and write handlers accept length arguments via pointer.
   On entry to the handler, the pointed-to value should be the amount
   of data which can be read or the amount of data to write.  When the
   handler returns, the value is reset to the amount of data actually
   read or written.  Handlers are obliged to complete a read or write
   to the maximum extent possible; thus, a short read with no
   associated error implies the end of the input stream, and a short
   write should never occur without an associated error.  */
