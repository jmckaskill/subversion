/* Return a canonicalized version of a filesystem PATH, allocated in
   POOL.  While the filesystem API is pretty flexible about the
   incoming paths (they must be UTF-8 with '/' as separators, but they
   don't have to begin with '/', and multiple contiguous '/'s are
   ignored) we want any paths that are physically stored in the
   underlying database to look consistent.  Specifically, absolute
   filesystem paths should begin with '/', and all redundant and trailing '/'
   characters be removed.  */
