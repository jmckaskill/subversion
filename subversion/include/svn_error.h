/*** Wrappers around APR pools, so we get error pools. ***/

/* THE ERROR POOL
 *
 * When SVN allocates an svn_error_t, it must do so from a pool. There is
 * almost always a pool available for a function to provide to the error
 * creation functions. However, that pool may have a shorter lifetime than
 * is required for the error (in many cases, the error needs to bubble all
 * the way to the top-most control function). Assuming that these shorter-
 * lifetime pools are cleared or even destroyed as the error propagates,
 * then we need a way to ensure that the error is allocated within the
 * proper pool, to get the proper lifetime.
 *
 * We create a pool specifically for errors. This pool is then "hung from"
 * the top-most pool that SVN will be using (whether this top-most pool is
 * provided by an embeddor such as Apache, or whether an SVN tool creates
 * the top-most pool itself). Since this error pool has a lifetime *at least*
 * as long as the top-most pool, then any errors allocated within it will
 * survive back to the top-most control function.
 *
 * We use a subpool rather than the top-most pool itself because we may want
 * to occasionally clear the error pool (say, if we get an error, recover,
 * and restart the operation).
 *
 * This subpool is called "the error pool". Using APR's "userdata" feature,
 * we associate the error pool with every subpool that SVN creates. When
 * the SVN error system allocates a new error, it first fetches the subpool
 * from the pool..
 */

/* You may be wondering why is this is in svn_error, instead of
   svn_pool or whatever.  The reason is the needs of the SVN error
   system are our only justification for wrapping APR's pool creation
   funcs -- because errors have to live as long as the top-most pool
   in a test program or a `request'.  If you're not using SVN errors,
   there's no reason not to use APR's native pool interface.  But you
   are using SVN errors, aren't you? */

/* Initalize the given pool as SVN's top-most pool. This is needed when SVN
 * is embedded in another application, and all of SVN's work will occur
 * within a given pool.
 *
 * This function will construct the error pool (for all errors to live
 * within), and hang it off of the given pool. When subpools are created
 * with svn_pool_create(), they will pick up this pool.
 *
 * Note: we return an apr_status_t since a catch-22 means we cannot allocate
 * an svn_error_t.
 *
 * WARNING: this is ONLY to be used for pools provided by an embeddor. Do not
 *          use it for pools returned by svn_pool_create().

 * pool will be a subpool of it, and will inherit the containing
 * pool's dedicated error subpool.
 *
 * If PARENT_POOL is NULL, then the returned pool will be a new "global"
 * pool (with no parent), and an error pool will be created.
 *
 * If anything goes wrong with the pool creation, then an abort function
 * will be called, which will exit the program. If future allocations from
 * this pool cannot be fulfilled, then the abort function will be called,
 * terminating the program.
