   The functions on this page create filesystem objects that use
   Berkeley DB (http://www.sleepycat.com) to store their data.
   Berkeley DB supports transactions and recoverability, making it
   well-suited for Subversion.

   A Berkeley DB ``environment'' is a Unix directory containing

   The recovery procedures require exclusive access to the database
   --- while they execute, no other process or thread may access the
   database.

   In a server with multiple worker processes, like Apache, if a
   worker process accessing the filesystem dies, you must stop the
   other worker processes, and run recovery.  Then, the other worker
   processes can re-open the database and resume work.

   If the server exited cleanly, there is no need to run recovery, but
   there is no harm in it, either, and it take very little time.  So
   it's a fine idea to run recovery when the server process starts,
   before it begins handling any requests.  */

/* Node and Node Revision ID's.  */

/* In a Subversion filesystem, a `node' corresponds roughly to an
   `inode' in a Unix filesystem:
   - A node is either a file or a directory.
   - A node's contents change over time.
   - When you change a node's contents, it's still the same node; it's
     just been changed.  So a node's identity isn't bound to a specific
     set of contents.
   - If you rename a node, it's still the same node, just under a
     different name.  So a node's identity isn't bound to a particular
     filename.

   A `node revision' refers to a node's contents at a specific point in
   time.  Changing a node's contents always creates a new revision of that
   node.  Once created, a node revision's contents never change.

   When we create a node, its initial contents are the initial revision of
   the node.  As users make changes to the node over time, we create new
   revisions of that same node.  When a user commits a change that deletes
   a file from the filesystem, we don't delete the node, or any revision
   of it --- those stick around to allow us to recreate prior revisions of
   the filesystem.  Instead, we just remove the reference to the node
   from the directory.

   Within the database, we refer to nodes and node revisions using strings
   of numbers separated by periods that look a lot like RCS revision
   numbers.

     node_id ::= number | node_revision_id "." number
     node_revision_id ::= node_id "." number

   So: 
   - "100" is a node id.
   - "100.10" is a node revision id, referring to revision 10 of node 100.
   - "100.10.3" is a node id, referring to the third branch based on
     revision 10 of node 100.
   - "100.10.3.4" is a node revision id, referring to revision 4 of
     of the third branch from revision 10 of node 100.
   And so on.

   Node revision numbers start with 1.  Thus, N.1 is the first revision
   of node N.

   Node / branch numbers start with 1.  Thus, N.M.1 is the first
   branch off of N.M.

   A directory entry identifies the file or subdirectory it refers to
   using a node revision number --- not a node number.  This means that
   a change to a file far down in a directory hierarchy requires the
   parent directory of the changed node to be updated, to hold the new
   node revision ID.  Now, since that parent directory has changed, its
   parent needs to be updated.

   If a particular subtree was unaffected by a given commit, the node
   revision ID that appears in its parent will be unchanged.  When
   doing an update, we can notice this, and ignore that entire
   subtree.  This makes it efficient to find localized changes in
   large trees.

   Note that the number specifying a particular revision of a node is
   unrelated to the global filesystem revision when that node revision
   was created.  So 100.10 may have been created in filesystem revision
   1218; 100.10.3.2 may have been created any time after 100.10; it
   doesn't matter.

   Since revision numbers increase by one each time a delta is added,
   we can compute how many deltas separate two related node revisions
   simply by comparing their ID's.  For example, the distance between
   100.10.3.2 and 100.12 is the distance from 100.10.3.2 to their
   common ancestor, 100.10 (two deltas), plus the distance from 100.10
   to 100.12 (two deltas).

   However, this is kind of a kludge, since the number of deltas is
   not necessarily an accurate indicator of how different two files
   are --- a single delta could be a minor change, or a complete
   replacement.  Furthermore, the filesystem may decide arbitrary to
   store a given node revision as a delta or as full text --- perhaps
   depending on how recently the node was used --- so revision id
   distance isn't necessarily an accurate predictor of retrieval time.

   If you have insights about how this stuff could work better, let me
   know.  I've read some of Josh MacDonald's stuff on this; his
   discussion seems to be mostly about how to retrieve things quickly,
   which is important, but only part of the issue.  I'd like to find
   better ways to recognize renames, and find appropriate ancestors in
   a source tree for changed files.  */

/* Transactions.  */


/* To make a change to a Subversion filesystem:
   - Create a transaction object, using `svn_fs_begin_txn'.
   - Call `svn_fs_txn_root', to get the transaction's root directory.
   - Make whatever changes you like in that tree.
   - Commit the transaction, using `svn_fs_commit_txn'.

   The filesystem implementation guarantees that your commit will
   either:
   - succeed completely, so that all of the changes are committed to
     create a new revision of the filesystem, or
   - fail completely, leaving the filesystem unchanged.

   Until you commit the transaction, any changes you make are
   invisible.  Only when your commit succeeds do they become visible
   to the outside world, as a new revision of the filesystem.

   If you begin a transaction, and then decide you don't want to make
   the change after all (say, because your net connection with the
   client disappeared before the change was complete), you can call
   `svn_fs_abort_txn', to cancel the entire transaction; this
   leaves the filesystem unchanged.

   The only way to change the contents of files or directories, or
   their properties, is by making a transaction and creating a new
   revision, as described above.  Once a revision has been committed, it
   never changes again; the filesystem interface provides no means to
   go back and edit the contents of an old revision.  Once history has
   been recorded, it is set in stone.  Clients depend on this property
   to do updates and commits reliably; proxies depend on this property
   to cache changes accurately; and so on.


   There are two kinds of nodes in the filesystem: mutable, and
   immutable.  Revisions in the filesystem consist entirely of
   immutable nodes, whose contents never change.  A transaction in
   progress, which the user is still constructing, uses mutable nodes
   for those nodes which have been changed so far, and refers to
   immutable nodes from existing revisions for portions of the tree
   which haven't been changed yet in that transaction.

   Immutable nodes, as part of revisions, never refer to mutable
   nodes, which are part of uncommitted transactions.  Mutable nodes
   may refer to immutable nodes, or other mutable nodes.

   Note that the terms "immutable" and "mutable" describe whether or
   not the nodes have been changed as part of a transaction --- not
   the permissions on the nodes they refer to.  Even if you aren't
   authorized to modify the filesystem's root directory, you might be
   authorized to change some descendant of the root; doing so would
   create a new mutable copy of the root directory.  Mutability refers
   to the role of the node: part of an existing revision, or part of a
   new one.  This is independent of your authorization to make changes
   to a given node.


   Transactions are actually persistent objects, stored in the
   database.  You can open a filesystem, begin a transaction, and
   close the filesystem, and then a separate process could open the
   filesystem, pick up the same transaction, and continue work on it.
   When a transaction is successfully committed, it is removed from
   the database.

   Every transaction is assigned a name.  You can open a transaction
   by name, and resume work on it, or find out the name of a
   transaction you already have open.  You can also list all the
   transactions currently present in the database.

   Transaction names are guaranteed to contain only letters (upper-
   and lower-case), digits, `-', and `.', from the ASCII character
   set.  */

   function returns an SVN_ERR_FS_PATH_SYNTAX error.

   A directory path is a sequence of zero or more directory entry
   names, separated by slash characters (U+002f), and possibly ending
   with slash characters.  Sequences of two or more consecutive slash
   characters are treated as if they were a single slash.  If a path
   ends with a slash, it refers to the same node it would without the
   slash, but that node must be a directory, or else the function
   returns an SVN_ERR_FS_NOT_DIRECTORY error.

   Notes:
      - Copy ancestry does not descend.  After copying directory D to
        E, E will have copy ancestry referring to D, but E's children
        may not.  See also svn_fs_copy().

      - Copy ancestry *under* a copy is preserved.  That is, if you
        copy /A/D/G/pi to /A/D/G/pi2, and then copy /A/D/G to /G, then
        /G/pi2 will still have copy ancestry pointing to /A/D/G/pi.
        We don't know if this is a feature or a bug yet; if it turns
        out to be a bug, then the fix is to make svn_fs_copied_from()
        observe the following logic, which currently callers may
        choose to follow themselves: if node X has copy history, but
        its ancestor A also has copy history, then you may ignore X's
        history if X's revision-of-origin is earlier than A's --
        because that would mean that X's copy history was preserved in
        a copy-under-a-copy scenario.  If X's revision-of-origin is
        the same as A's, then it was copied under A during the same
        transaction that created A.  (X's revision-of-origin cannot be
        greater than A's, if X has copy history.)  ### todo: See how
        people like this, it can always be hidden behind the curtain
        if necessary.

      - Copy ancestry is not stored as a regular subversion property
        because it is not inherited.  Copying foo to bar results in a
        revision of bar with copy ancestry; but committing a text
        change to bar right after that results in a new revision of
        bar without copy ancestry.  */
