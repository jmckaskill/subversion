/** Overview of the @c SVN_PROP_MERGEINFO property.
 *
 * Merge history is stored in the @c SVN_PROP_MERGEINFO property of files
 * and directories.  The @c SVN_PROP_MERGEINFO property on a path stores the
 * complete list of changes merged to that path, either directly or via the
 * path's parent, grand-parent, etc..
 *
 * Every path in a tree may have @c SVN_PROP_MERGEINFO set, but if the
 * @c SVN_PROP_MERGEINFO for a path is equivalent to the
 * @c SVN_PROP_MERGEINFO for its parent, then the @c SVN_PROP_MERGEINFO on
 * the path will 'elide' (be removed) from the path as a post step to any
 * merge, switch, or update.  If a path's parent does not have any
 * @c SVN_PROP_MERGEINFO set, the path's mergeinfo can elide to its nearest
 * grand-parent, great-grand-parent, etc. that has equivalent
 * @c SVN_PROP_MERGEINFO set on it.  
 *
 * If a path has no @c SVN_PROP_MERGEINFO of its own, it inherits mergeinfo
 * from its nearest parent that has @c SVN_PROP_MERGEINFO set.  The
 * exception to this is @c SVN_PROP_MERGEINFO with non-ineritable revision
 * ranges.  These non-inheritable ranges apply only to the path which they
 * are set on.
 *
 * The value of the @c SVN_PROP_MERGEINFO property is a string consisting of
 * a path, a colon, and comma separated revision list, containing one or more
 * revision or revision ranges. Revision range start and end points are
 * separated by "-".  Revisions and revision ranges may have the optional
 * @c SVN_MERGEINFO_NONINHERITABLE_STR suffix to signify a non-inheritable
 * revision/revision range.
 *
 * @c SVN_PROP_MERGEINFO Value Grammar:
 *
 *   Token             Definition
 *   -----             ----------
 *   revisionrange     REVISION1 "-" REVISION2
 *   revisioneelement  (revisionrange | REVISION)"*"?
 *   rangelist         revisioneelement (COMMA revisioneelement)*
 *   revisionline      PATHNAME COLON rangelist
 *   top               revisionline (NEWLINE revisionline)*
 *
 * The PATHNAME is the source of a merge and the rangelist the revision(s)
 * merged to the path @c SVN_PROP_MERGEINFO is set on directly or indirectly
 * via inheritance.  PATHNAME must always exist at the specified rangelist
 * and thus multiple revisionlines are required to account for renames of
 * the source pathname.
 *
 * Rangelists must be sorted from lowest to highest revision and cannot
 * contain overlapping revisionlistelements.  REVISION1 must be less than
 * REVISION2.  Consecutive single revisions that can be represented by a
 * revisionrange are allowed (e.g. '5,6,7,8,9-12' or '5-12' are both
 * acceptable).

 * (never @c NULL).  Perform temporary allocations in @a pool.
