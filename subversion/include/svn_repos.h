   sure it's identical to FS_BASE or FS_BASE/TARGET.)

/*** The magical dir_delta update routines. */

/* Use the provided EDITOR and EDIT_BATON to describe the changes
   necessary for making a given node (and its descendants, if it a
   directory) under SRC_ROOT look exactly like TGT_PATH under
   TGT_ROOT.  SRC_ENTRY is the node to update, and is either NULL or a
   single path component.  If SRC_ENTRY is NULL, then compute the
   difference between the entire tree anchored at SRC_PARENT_DIR under
   SRC_ROOT and TGT_PATH under TARGET_ROOT.  Else, describe the
   changes needed to update only that entry in SRC_PARENT_DIR.
   Typically, callers of this function will use a TGT_PATH that is the
   concatenation of SRC_PARENT_DIR and SRC_ENTRY.

   SRC_ROOT and TGT_ROOT can both be either revision or transaction
   roots.  If TGT_ROOT is a revision, EDITOR's set_target_revision()
   will be called with the TGT_ROOT's revision number, else it will
   not be called at all.

   SRC_REVS is a hash whose keys are character string paths, and whose
   values are pointers to svn_revnum_t's, which describes the base
   revisions of the items in the SRC_PARENT tree.  This hash need only
   contain the base revision for the top of that tree, and then those
   paths that have a base revision that differs from that of their
   parent directory.

   If TEXT_DELTAS is FALSE, only a single NULL txdelta window will be
   sent to the window handler returned by EDITOR->apply_textdelta().

   Before completing successfully, this function calls EDITOR's
   close_edit(), so the caller should expect its EDIT_BATON to be
   invalid after its use with this function.

   Do any allocation necessary for the delta computation in POOL.
   This function's maximum memory consumption is at most roughly
   proportional to the greatest depth of the tree under TGT_ROOT, not
   the total size of the delta.
