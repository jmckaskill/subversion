/*** Reporting the state of a working copy, for updates. */


/* Construct and return a REPORT_BATON that will be paired with some
   svn_ra_reporter_t table.  The table and baton are used to build a
   transaction in the system;  when the report is finished,
   svn_repos_dir_delta is called on the transaction, driving
   EDITOR/EDIT_BATON. 

   Specifically, the report will create a transaction made by
   USERNAME, relative to FS_BASE in the filesystem.  TARGET is a
   single path component, used to limit the scope of the report to a
   single entry of FS_BASE, or NULL if all of FS_BASE itself is the
   main subject of the report.

   TGT_PATH and REVNUM is the fs path/revision pair that is the
   "target" of dir_delta.  In other words, a tree delta will be
   returned that transforms the transaction into TGT_PATH/REVNUM.
   TGT_PATH may (indeed, should) be NULL when the source and target
   paths of the report are the same.  That is, TGT_PATH should *only*
   be specified when specifying that the resultant editor drive be one
   that tranforms the reported heirarchy into a pristing tree of
   TGT_PATH at revision REVNUM.  Else, a NULL value for TGT_PATH will
   indicate that the editor should be driven in such a way as to
   transform the reported heirarchy to revision REVNUM, preserving the
   reported heirarchy.

   TEXT_DELTAS instructs the driver of the EDITOR to enable to disable
   the generation of text deltas.

   RECURSE instructs the driver of the EDITOR to send a recursive
   delta (or not.)

   All allocation for the context and collected state will occur in
   POOL. */

/*** The magical dir_delta update routines. */

/* Use the provided EDITOR and EDIT_BATON to describe the changes
   necessary for making a given node (and its descendants, if it a
   directory) under SRC_ROOT look exactly like TGT_PATH under
   TGT_ROOT.  SRC_ENTRY is the node to update, and is either NULL or a
   single path component.  If SRC_ENTRY is NULL, then compute the
   difference between the entire tree anchored at SRC_PARENT_DIR under
   SRC_ROOT and TGT_PATH under TARGET_ROOT.  Else, describe the
   changes needed to update only that entry in SRC_PARENT_DIR.
   Typically, callers of this function will use a TGT_PATH that is the
   concatenation of SRC_PARENT_DIR and SRC_ENTRY.

   SRC_ROOT and TGT_ROOT can both be either revision or transaction
   roots.  If TGT_ROOT is a revision, EDITOR's set_target_revision()
   will be called with the TGT_ROOT's revision number, else it will
   not be called at all.

   SRC_REVS is a hash whose keys are character string paths, and whose
   values are pointers to svn_revnum_t's, which describes the base
   revisions of the items in the SRC_PARENT tree.  This hash need only
   contain the base revision for the top of that tree, and then those
   paths that have a base revision that differs from that of their
   parent directory.

   If TEXT_DELTAS is FALSE, send a single NULL txdelta window to the
   window handler returned by EDITOR->apply_textdelta().

   If ENTRY_PROPS is TRUE, accompany each opened/added entry with
   propchange editor calls that relay special "entry props" (this
   is typically used only for working copy updates).

   If USE_COPY_HISTORY is TRUE, then when recursing on a node with
   copy history, express differences as against the node referred to
   by that copy history.  Else if USE_COPY_HISTORY is FALSE, then
   express differences as full adds (i.e., all directory entries are
   reported as adds, and text deltas are sent against the empty
   string).  Either way, pass `copyfrom' arguments through to the
   EDITOR's add_file and add_directory when copy history is present.

   Before completing successfully, this function calls EDITOR's
   close_edit(), so the caller should expect its EDIT_BATON to be
   invalid after its use with this function.

   Do any allocation necessary for the delta computation in POOL.
   This function's maximum memory consumption is at most roughly
   proportional to the greatest depth of the tree under TGT_ROOT, not
   the total size of the delta.

   in a general sense:

        a REVISION_NUMBER or NODE_PATH headers.

      * it recognizes the CONTENT-LENGTH headers, so it knows if and
        how to suck up the content body.

      * it knows how to parse a content body into two parts:  props
        and text, and pass the pieces to the vtable.

   This is enough knowledge to make it easy on vtable implementors,
   but still allow expansion of the format:  most headers are ignored.
