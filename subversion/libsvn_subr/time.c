/* Our timestamp strings look like this:
 * 
 *    "Tue 3 Oct 2000 HH:MM:SS.UUU (day 277, dst 1, gmt_off -18000)"
 *
 * The idea is that they are conventionally human-readable for the
 * first part, and then in parentheses comes everything else required
 * to completely fill in an apr_exploded_time_t: tm_yday, tm_isdst,
 * and tm_gmtoff.
 *
 * kff todo: what about portability problems resulting from the
 * plain int assumptions below, though?  Using apr_strftime() would
 * fix that, but converting the strings back is still a problem (see
 * the comment in svn_wc__time_to_string()).

/* ### todo:

   Recently Branko changed svn_time_from_string (or rather, he changed
   svn_wc__string_to_time, but the function's name has changed since
   then) to use apr_implode_gmt.  So now that function is using GMT,
   but its inverse above, svn_time_to_string, is using localtime.

   I'm not sure what the right thing to do is; see issue #404.  See
   also the thread entitled "apr_implode_time and time zones" in the
   APR dev mailing list archives:

      http://apr.apache.org/mail/dev/200106.gz

   That discussion between Branko and David Reid is directly
   relevant.

   Note that Subversion repositories probably want to record commit
   dates in GMT.  Maybe we should just make Subversion's string
   representation for times always use GMT -- that's good for
   repositories, and for working copies it doesn't really matter since
   humans don't have to read the timestamps in SVN/entries files much
   (and when they do, they can easily do the conversion).  */
