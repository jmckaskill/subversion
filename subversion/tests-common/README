This directory contains a number of items related to testing.

1.  svn_tests_main.c 

    This produces a shared library "libsvn_tests_main", which contains
    a standardized main() that is linked into all Subversion automated
    test-programs.

    For a description of how the Subversion automated testing suite
    works, read TEST-FRAMEWORK.


2.  svn_tests_editor.c

    This produces a shared library "libsvn_tests_editor", which
    contains a reusable `dummy' editor to be used with test programs.
    (The editor's callbacks simply print information to stdout.)

3.  xml/ subdirectory

    Contains various <delta-pkg> XML files for parser testing.
