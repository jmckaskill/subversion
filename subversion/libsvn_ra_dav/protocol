This file documents Subversion's use of the WebDAV/DeltaV protocol.


IMPORTANT RFCs and LINKS
========================

  * RFC 2518  (WebDAV)

  * RFC 3253  (DeltaV)

  * Subversion's limited uses of DeltaV, as well as interoperability
    issues, are explained in the "WebDAV" appendix of the free
    Subversion book (at http://svnbook.red-bean.com)




HTTP METHODS USED, indexed by svn commands that access network
==============================================================


Read Commands  :  (OPTIONS, PROPFIND, GET, REPORT)
-------------

  Most commands have to resolve peg-revisions before starting:

  * -r X foo@Y      REPORT                        ('get-locations')

       ...if an old server doesn't support 'get-locations' report, the
       client traces history using the 'log-report' instead.

  And any command which has to convert a date to a revision:

  * -r {DATE}       REPORT                        ('dated-rev-report')


  The following group of commands all use the custom 'update-report'
  request, which is just a fancy way of driving svn_repos_dir_delta():

  * svn checkout:   OPTIONS, PROPFIND, REPORT     ('update-report')

  * svn export:     OPTIONS, PROPFIND, REPORT     ('update-report')

  * svn update:     OPTIONS, PROPFIND, REPORT     ('update-report')

  * svn switch:     OPTIONS, PROPFIND, REPORT     ('update-report')

  * svn diff:       OPTIONS, PROPFIND, REPORT     ('update-report')
                    ... then many GETs

  * svn merge:      OPTIONS, PROPFIND, REPORT     ('update-report')
                    ... then many GETs

  * svn status -u:  OPTIONS, PROPFIND, REPORT     ('update-report' and
                                                   'get-locks-report')

  * svn cp URL wc:  OPTIONS, PROPFIND, REPORT     ('update-report')


  And these guys are left over:

  * svn log:        OPTIONS, PROPFIND, REPORT     ('log-report')

  * svn blame:      OPTIONS, PROPFIND, REPORT     ('file-revs-report')
                    [older clients use GET
                     and different REPORT]        ('log-report')

  * svn cat:        OPTIONS, PROPFIND, GET

  * svn info URL:   PROPFIND

  * svn ls:         PROPFIND, REPORT              ('get-locks-report')






Write Commands  :  (MKACTIVITY, PROPPATCH, PUT, CHECKOUT, MKCOL, MOVE,
--------------      COPY, DELETE, LOCK, UNLOCK, MERGE)

  With the exception of LOCK/UNLOCK, every write command performs some
  sort of DeltaV commit operation.  In DeltaV, a commit always starts
  by creating a transaction (MKACTIVITY), applies a log message
  (PROPPATCH), does some other write methods, and then ends by
  committing the transaction (MERGE).  If the MERGE fails, the client
  may try to clean up the transaction with a DELETE.

  * svn commit:     OPTIONS, PROPFIND, MKACTIVITY, 
                    {CHECKOUT, COPY, MOVE, DELETE, PROPPATCH, PUT, MKCOL},
                    MERGE (DELETE)

  * svn import:     OPTIONS, PROPFIND, MKACTIVITY,
                    {PROPPATCH, PUT, MKCOL},
                    MERGE (DELETE)

  * svn lock:       PROPFIND, LOCK
  
  * svn unlock:     PROPFIND, UNLOCK

  * svn cp URL URL: OPTIONS, PROPFIND, MKACTIVITY, PROPPATCH,
                    COPY, MERGE.  (DELETE)

  * svn mv URL URL: OPTIONS, PROPFIND, MKACTIVITY, PROPPATCH,
                    COPY, DELETE, MERGE.  (DELETE)

  * svn rm URL:     OPTIONS, PROPFIND, MKACTIVITY, PROPPATCH, DELETE, MERGE.

  * svn mkdir URL:  OPTIONS, PROPFIND, MKACTIVITY, PROPPATCH, MKCOL, MERGE.
