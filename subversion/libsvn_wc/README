     Oh Most High and Fragrant Emacs, please be in -*- text -*- mode!

This is the library described in the section "The working copy
management library" of svn-design.texi.  It performs local operations
in the working copy, tweaking administrative files and versioned data.
It does not communicate directly with a repository; instead, other
libraries that do talk to the repository call into this library to
make queries and changes in the working copy.


The Problem We're Solving.
==========================

The working copy is arranged as a directory tree, which, at checkout,
mirrors a tree rooted at some node in the repository.  Over time, the
working copy accumulates uncommitted changes, some of which may affect
its tree layout.  By commit time, the working copy's layout could be
arbitrarily different from the repository tree on which it was based.

Furthermore, updates/commits do not always involve the entire tree, so
it is possible for the working copy to go a very long time without
being a perfect mirror of some tree in the repository.


One Way We're Not Solving It.
=============================

Updates and commits are about merging two trees that share a common
ancestor, but have diverged since that ancestor.  In real life, one of
the trees comes from the working copy, the other from the repository.
But when thinking about how to merge two such trees, we can ignore the
question of which is the working copy and which is the repository,
because the principles involved are symmetrical.

Why do we say symmetrical?

It's tempting to think of a change as being either "from" the working
copy or "in" the repository.  But the true source of a change is some
committer -- each change represents some developer's intention toward
a file or a tree, and a conflict is what happens when two intentions
are incompatible (or their compatibility cannot be automatically
determined).

It doesn't matter in what order the intentions were discovered --
which has already made it into the repository versus which exists only
in someone's working copy.  Incompatibility is incompatibility,
independent of timing.

In fact, a working copy can be viewed as a "branch" off the
repository, and the changes committed in the repository *since* then
represent another, divergent branch.  Thus, every update or commit is
a general branch-merge problem:

   - An update is an attempt to merge the repository's branch into the
     working copy's branch, and the attempt may fail wholly or
     partially depending on the number of conflicts.

   - A commit is an attempt to merge the working copy's branch into
     the repository.  The exact same algorithm is used as with
     updates, the only difference being that a commit must succeed
     completely or not at all.  That last condition is merely a
     useability decision: the repository tree is shared by many
     people, so folding both sides of a conflict into it to aid
     resolution would actually make it less useable, not more.  On the
     other hand, representing both sides of a conflict in a working
     copy is often helpful to the person who owns that copy.

So below we consider the general problem of how to merge two trees
that have a common ancestor.  The concrete tree layout discussed will
be that of the working copy, because this library needs to know
exactly how to massage a working copy from one state to another.


Structure of the Working Copy
=============================

Working copy meta-information is stored in SVN/ subdirectories,
analogous to CVS/ sudirs:

   SVN/README                   /* No, it's not this file.  Details below. */
       format                   /* Contains wc adm format version. */
       repository               /* Where this stuff came from. */
       entries                  /* Various adm info for each directory entry */
       properties               /* Properties for this directory */
       lock                     /* Optional, tells others this dir is busy */
       log                      /* Ops log (for rollback/crash-recovery) */
       text-base/               /* Pristine repos versions of the files... */
            foo.c
            bar.c
            baz.c
       prop-base/               /* Pristine repos hashdumps of these files
            foo.c                  /* Stores bar.c's file properties */
            bar.c
            baz.c
       tmp/                     /* Local tmp area */
            ./                     /* Adm files are written directly here. */
            text-base/             /* tmp area for base files */
            prop-base/             /* tmp area for base props */

`README'

   If someone doesn't know what a Subversion working copy is, this
   will tell them how to find out more about Subversion.

   Also, the presence of this file means that the entire process of
   creating the adm area was completed, because this is always the
   last file created.  Of course, that's no guarantee that someone
   didn't muck things up afterwards, but it's good enough for
   existence-checking.

`format'

   Says what version of the working copy adm format this is (so future
   clients can be backwards compatible easily).

`repository'

   Where this dir came from (syntax TBD).

`entries':

   This file holds version numbers and other information for this
   directory and its files, and records the presence of subdirs (but
   does not record much other information about them, as the subdirs
   do that themselves).

   The entries file contains an XML expression like this:

      <wc-entries xmlns="http://subversion.tigris.org/xmlns/blah">
        <entry ancestor="/path/to/here/in/repos" version="5"/>
            <!-- no name in above entry means it refers to the dir itself -->
        <entry name="foo.c" version="5"/>
        <entry name="bar.c" version="5" timestamp="blah..." checksum="blah"/>
        <entry name="baz.c" version="6"/>
        <entry name="X" new="true" version="0"/>
        <entry name="Y" new="true" ancestor="ancestor/path/Y" version="3"/>
        <entry name="qux" kind="dir" />
      </wc-entries>

   Where:

      1. `kind' defaults to "file".

      2. `version' defaults to the directory's version (in the
         directory's own entry, the version may not be omitted).

      3. `ancestor' defaults to the directory's ancestor, prepended
         (according to the repository's path conventions) to the entry
         name in question.  This directory's ancestor may not be
         omitted, but conversely, subdirectories may not record
         ancestry information in their parent's entries file.

      4. `timestamp' and `checksum' are optional.

   When a file or dir is added, that is recorded here too, in the
   following manner:

      1. Added files are recorded with the "new='true'" flag; if they
         are truly new, their initial version is 0, otherwise their
         ancestory is recorded (see files X and Y in the example).

      2. Added dirs get the "new='true'" flag too, but they record
         their own ancestry.

   Child directories of the current directory are recorded here, but
   their ancestry information is omitted.  The idea is to make the
   child's existence known to the current directory; all other
   information about the child directory is stored in its own SVN/
   subdir.

`properties'

   Properties for this directory.  

   For now, this file is in svn hashdump format, because it's
   convenient and its performance is good enough for now.  May move to
   Berkeley DB if properties ever get that demanding.  XML is another
   possibility -- it's less efficient, disk-wise, but on the other
   hand its easy to parse it streamily, unlike hashdump format, which
   generally results in a complete data structure in memory before you
   can do anything at all.

`lock'

   Present iff some client is using this SVN/ subdir for anything.
   kff todo: I think we don't need read vs write types, nor
   race-condition protection, due to the way locking is called.  We'll
   see, though.

`log'

   This file (XML format) holds a log of actions that are about to be
   done, or are in the process of being done.  Each action is of the
   sort that, given a log entry for it, one can tell unambiguously
   whether or not the action was successfully done.  Thus, in
   recovering from a crash or an interrupt, the wc library reads over
   the log file, ignoring those actions that have already been done,
   and doing the ones that have not.  When all the actions in log have
   been done, the log file is removed.

   Soon there will be a general explanation/algorithm for using the
   log file; for now, this example gives the flavor:

   To do a fresh checkout of `iota' in directory `.'

      1. add_file() produces the new ./SVN/tmp/SVN/entries, which
         probably is the same as the original `entries' file since
         `iota' is likely to be the same version as its parent
         directory.  (But not necessarily...)

      2. apply_textdelta() hands window_handler() to its caller.

      3. window_handler() is invoked N times, constructing
         ./SVN/tmp/iota

      4. finish_file() is called.  First, it creates `log' atomically,
         with the following items,

            <mv src="SVN/tmp/iota" dst="SVN/text-base/iota">
            <mv src="SVN/tmp/SVN/entries" dst="SVN/entries">
            <merge src="SVN/text-base/iota" dst="iota">

         Then it does the operations in the log file one by one.
         When it's done, it removes the log.

   To recover from a crash:

      1. Look for a log file.  

           A. If none, just "rm -r tmp/*".

           B. Else, run over the log file from top to bottom,
              attempting to do each action.  If an action turns out to
              have already been done, that's fine, just ignore it.
              When done, remove the log file.

   Probably the same routine will be used by finish_file() and in
   crash recovery.

`tmp'

   A shallow mirror of the working directory (i.e., the parent of the
   SVN/ subdirectory), giving us reproducible tmp names.

   When the working copy library needs a tmp file for something in the
   SVN dir, it uses tmp/thing, for example SVn/tmp/entries, or
   SVN/tmp/text-base/foo.c.  When it needs a *very* temporary file for
   something in SVN (such as when local changes during an update), use
   tmp/SVN/blah$PID.tmp.  Since no SVN/ file ever has a .blah
   extension, if something ends in .*, then it must be a tmp file.

   See discussion of the `log' file for more details.

`text-base/'

   Each file in text-base/ is a pristine repository version of that
   file, corresponding to the version indicated in `entries'.  These
   files are used for sending diffs back to the server, etc.

`prop-base/'

   Pristine repos properties for those files, in hashdump format.
   todo: may also store dirent props here, lots of good formats for
   mixing those two, would pick one when we implement the dirent
   props.  Or may store them some other way; think this will be best
   answered after having the rest of the library working.


------------------------
todo: some loose ends

   1. filename escaping in SVN/entries
   2. 



How the client applies an update delta.
---------------------------------------

Updating is more than just bringing changes down from the repository;
it's also folding those changes into the working copy.  Getting the
right changes is the easy part -- folding them in is hard.

Before we examine how Subversion handles this, let's look at what CVS
does:

   1. Unmodified portions of the working copy are simply brought
      up-to-date.  The server sends a forward diff, the client applies
      it.

   2. Locally modified portions are "merged", where possible.  That
      is, the changes from the repository are incorporated into the
      local changes in an intelligent way (if the diff application
      succeeds, then no conflict, else go to 3...)

   3. Where merging is not possible, a conflict is flagged, and *both*
      sides of the conflict are folded into the local file in such a
      way that it's easy for the developer to figure out what
      happened.  (And the old locally-modified file is saved under a
      temp name, just in case.)

It would be nice for Subversion to do things this way too;
unfortunately, that's not possible in every case.

CVS has a wonderfully simplifying limitation: it doesn't version
directories, so never has tree-structure conflicts.  Given that only
textual conflicts are possible, there is usually a natural way to
express both sides of a conflict -- just include the opposing texts
inside the file, delimited with conflict markers.  (Or for binary
files, make both versions available under temporary names.)

While Subversion can behave the same way for textual conflicts, the
situation is more complex for trees.  There is sometimes no way for a
working copy to reflect both sides of a tree conflict without being
more confusing than helpful.  How does one put "conflict markers" into
a directory, especially when what was a directory might now be a file,
or vice-versa?

Therefore, while Subversion does everything it can to fold conflicts
intelligently (doing at least as well as CVS does), in extreme cases
it is acceptable for the Subversion client to punt, saying in effect
"Your working copy is too out of whack; please move it aside, check
out a fresh one, redo your changes in the fresh copy, and commit from
that."  (This response may also apply to subtrees of the working copy,
of course).

Usually it offers more detail than that, too.  In addition to the
overall out-of-whackness message, it can say "Directory foo was
renamed to bar, conflicting with your new file bar; file blah was
deleted, conflicting with your local change to file blah, ..." and so
on.  The important thing is that these are informational only -- they
tell the user what's wrong, but they don't try to fix it
automatically.

All this is purely a matter of *client-side* intelligence.  Nothing in
the repository logic or protocol affects the client's ability to fold
conflicts.  So as we get smarter, and/or as there is demand for more
informative conflicting updates, the client's behavior can improve and
punting can become a rare event.  We should start out with a _simple_
conflict-folding algorithm initially, though.
