     Oh Most High and Fragrant Emacs, please be in -*- text -*- mode!

This is the library described in the section "The working copy
management library" of svn-design.texi.  It performs local operations
in the working copy, tweaking administrative files and versioned data.
It does not communicate directly with a repository; instead, other
libraries that do talk to the repository call into this library to
make queries and changes in the working copy.


The Problem We're Solving.
==========================

The working copy is arranged as a directory tree, which, at checkout,
mirrors a tree rooted at some node in the repository.  Over time, the
working copy accumulates uncommitted changes, some of which may affect
its tree layout.  By commit time, the working copy's layout could be
arbitrarily different from the repository tree on which it was based.

Furthermore, updates/commits do not always involve the entire tree, so
it is possible for the working copy to go a very long time without
being a perfect mirror of some tree in the repository.


One Way We're Not Solving It.
=============================

Updates and commits are about merging two trees that share a common
ancestor, but have diverged since that ancestor.  In real life, one of
the trees comes from the working copy, the other from the repository.
But when thinking about how to merge two such trees, we can ignore the
question of which is the working copy and which is the repository,
because the principles involved are symmetrical.

Why do we say symmetrical?

It's tempting to think of a change as being either "from" the working
copy or "in" the repository.  But the true source of a change is some
committer -- each change represents some developer's intention toward
a file or a tree, and a conflict is what happens when two intentions
are incompatible (or their compatibility cannot be automatically
determined).

It doesn't matter in what order the intentions were discovered --
which has already made it into the repository versus which exists only
in someone's working copy.  Incompatibility is incompatibility,
independent of timing.

In fact, a working copy can be viewed as a "branch" off the
repository, and the changes committed in the repository *since* then
represent another, divergent branch.  Thus, every update or commit is
a general branch-merge problem:

   - An update is an attempt to merge the repository's branch into the
     working copy's branch, and the attempt may fail wholly or
     partially depending on the number of conflicts.

   - A commit is an attempt to merge the working copy's branch into
     the repository.  The exact same algorithm is used as with
     updates, the only difference being that a commit must succeed
     completely or not at all.  That last condition is merely a
     usability decision: the repository tree is shared by many
     people, so folding both sides of a conflict into it to aid
     resolution would actually make it less usable, not more.  On the
     other hand, representing both sides of a conflict in a working
     copy is often helpful to the person who owns that copy.

So below we consider the general problem of how to merge two trees
that have a common ancestor.  The concrete tree layout discussed will
be that of the working copy, because this library needs to know
exactly how to massage a working copy from one state to another.


Structure of the Working Copy
=============================

Working copy meta-information is stored in .svn/ subdirectories,
analogous to CVS/ subdirs:

  .svn/format                   /* Contains wc adm format version. */
       entries                  /* Various adm info for each directory entry */
       dir-props                /* Optional, Working properties for this
                                   directory */
       dir-prop-base            /* Optional, pristine properties for this
                                   directory */
       dir-prop-revert          /* Optional, dir base-props, used when
                                   reverting. */
       lock                     /* Optional, tells others this dir is busy */
       log                      /* Optional, ops log (for rollback
                                   crash-recovery) */
       log.N                    /* Optional, additional ops logs (N is
                                   an integer >= 1.) */
       text-base/               /* Pristine repos revisions of the files... */
            foo.c.svn-base
            foo.c.svn-revert    /* Optional, text-base used when
                                   reverting. */
       props/                   /* Working properties for files in this dir */
            foo.c.svn-work         /* Optional, Stores foo.c's working
                                      properties */
       prop-base/               /* Pristine properties for files in this dir */
            foo.c.svn-base         /* Optional, stores foo.c's
                                      pristine properties */
            foo.c.svn-revert       /* Optional, text base when
                                      reverting. */
       wcprops/                 /* Special 'wc' props for files in
                                   this dir, if any. */
            foo.c.svn-work          /* Optional. */
       dir-wcprops              /* Optional, 'wc' props for this directory. */
       tmp/                     /* Local tmp area */
            ./                     /* Adm files are written directly here. */
            text-base/             /* tmp area for base files */
            prop-base/             /* tmp area for base props */
            props/                 /* tmp area for props */
       empty-file               /* An empty file, for convenience, not used. */

`format'

   Says what version of the working copy adm format this is (so future
   clients can be backwards compatible easily).
   The changes in each format are listed in wc.h.

   Also, the presence of this file means that the entire process of
   creating the adm area was completed, because this is always the
   last file created.  Of course, that's no guarantee that someone
   didn't muck things up afterwards, but it's good enough for
   existence-checking.

`entries':

   This file holds revision numbers and other information for this
   directory and its files, and records the presence of subdirs (but
   does not record much other information about them, as the subdirs
   do that themselves).  See below for more information.

`dir-props'

   Properties for this directory.  These are the "working" properties
   that may be changed by the user.

`dir-prop-base'

   Same as `dir-props', except this is the pristine copy;  analogous to
   the "text-base" revisions of files.  The last up-to-date copy of the
   directory's properties live here. 

`dir-prop-revert':
   This is the base-props for this directory for the deleted directory
   in a schedule replace situation.  If this file doesn't exist, the
   `dir-prop-base' file is used. 

`lock'

   Present if some client is using this .svn/ subdir for anything that
   requires write access.

`log' and `log.N'

   These files (XML fragments) hold a log of actions that are about to be
   done, or are in the process of being done.  Each action is of the
   sort that, given a log entry for it, one can tell unambiguously
   whether or not the action was successfully done.  Thus, in
   recovering from a crash or an interrupt, the wc library reads over
   the log file, ignoring those actions that have already been done,
   and doing the ones that have not.  When all the actions in log have
   been done, the log files are removed.

   Some operations produce more than one log file.  The first log file
   is named `log', the next `log.1' and so on.  Processing the log
   files starts at `log' and stops after `log.N' when there is no `log.N+1'
   (counting the first log file as `log.0'; it is named `log' for
   compatibility.)

   Soon there will be a general explanation/algorithm for using the
   log file; for now, this example gives the flavor:

   To do a fresh checkout of `iota' in directory `.'

      1. add_file() produces the new ./.svn/tmp/.svn/entries, which
         probably is the same as the original `entries' file since
         `iota' is likely to be the same revision as its parent
         directory.  (But not necessarily...)

      2. apply_textdelta() hands window_handler() to its caller.

      3. window_handler() is invoked N times, constructing
         ./.svn/tmp/iota

      4. finish_file() is called.  First, it creates `log' atomically,
         with the following items,

            <mv src=".svn/tmp/iota" dst=".svn/text-base/iota">
            <mv src=".svn/tmp/.svn/entries" dst=".svn/entries">
            <merge src=".svn/text-base/iota" dst="iota">

         Then it does the operations in the log file one by one.
         When it's done, it removes the log.

   To recover from a crash:

      1. Look for a log file.  

           A. If none, just "rm -r tmp/*".

           B. Else, run over the log file from top to bottom,
              attempting to do each action.  If an action turns out to
              have already been done, that's fine, just ignore it.
              When done, remove the log file.


   Note that foo/.svn/log always uses paths relative to foo/, for
   example, this:
   
       <!-- THIS IS GOOD -->
       <mv name=".svn/tmp/prop-base/name"
           dest=".svn/prop-base/name">
           
   rather than this:

       <!-- THIS WOULD BE BAD -->
       <mv name="/home/joe/project/.svn/tmp/prop-base/name"
           dest="/home/joe/project/.svn/prop-base/name">

   or this:

       <!-- THIS WOULD ALSO BE BAD -->
       <mv name="tmp/prop-base/name"
           dest="prop-base/name">

   The problem with the second way is that is violates the
   separability of .svn subdirectories -- a subdir should be operable
   independent of its location in the local filesystem.  

   The problem with the third way is that it can't conveniently refer
   to the user's actual working files, only to files inside .svn/.

`tmp'

   A shallow mirror of the working directory (i.e., the parent of the
   .svn/ subdirectory), giving us reproducible tmp names.

   When the working copy library needs a tmp file for something in the
   .svn dir, it uses tmp/thing, for example .svn/tmp/entries, or
   .svn/tmp/text-base/foo.c.svn-base.  When temp file with a unique name
   is needed, use the `.tmp' extension to distinguish it from temporary
   admin files with well-known names.

   See discussion of the `log' file for more details.

`text-base/'

   Each file in text-base/ is a pristine repository revision of that
   file, corresponding to the revision indicated in `entries'.  These
   files are used for sending diffs back to the server, etc.

   A file named `foo.c' in the working copy will be named `foo.c.svn-base'
   in this directory.

   For a file scheduled for replacement, the text-base of the deleted
   entry may be stored in `foo.c.svn-revert'.

`prop-base/'

   Pristine repos properties for those files, in hashdump format.  Named
   with the extension `.svn-base'.

   For an entry scheduled for replacement, the text-base of the deleted
   entry may be stored in `foo.c.svn-revert'.

   
`props/'

   The non-pristine (working copy) of each file's properties.  These
   are where local modifications to properties live.  The files in this
   directory are given `.svn-work' extensions.

   Notice that right now, Subversion's ability to handle metadata
   (properties) is a bit limited:

   1. Properties are not "streamy" the same way a file's text is.
      Properties are held entirely in memory.

   2. Property *lists* are also held entirely in memory.  Property
      lists move back and forth between hashtables and our disk-based
      `hashdump' format.  Anytime a user wishes to read or write an
      individual property, the *entire* property list is loaded from
      disk into memory, and written back out again.  Not exactly a
      paradigm of efficiency!

   In other words, for Subversion 1.0, properties work sufficiently,
   but shouldn't be abused.  They work fine for storing information
   like ACLs, permissions, ownership, and notes; but users shouldn't
   be trying to store 30 meg PNG files.  :)

'wcprops/' and 'dir-wcprops'

   Some properties are never seen or set by the user, and are never
   stored in the repository filesystem.  They are created by the
   networking layer (DAV right now) and need to be secretly saved and
   retrieved, much like a web browser stores "cookies".  Special wc
   library routines allow the networking layer to get and set these
   properties.  

   Note that because these properties aren't being versioned, we don't
   bother to keep pristine forms of them in a 'base' area.  Nor do we
   paranoid-ly move them through .svn/tmp/ when changing them.  These
   sorts of behaviors are meant for preserving sacred user data,
   especially local modifications.  wcprops, on the other hand, are
   just internal tracking data used by the system, like the 'entries'
   file.

`empty-file':
   This files was added in format 4 and earlier.  This was used to
   create file diffs against the empty file (i.e. for adds and
   deletes).

`README':
   This file was removed in format 5.  It used to contain a short text
   saying what this directory is for and warning users not to alter
   its contents.
   
The entries file
----------------

The entries file contains an XML document with a top-level element
named `wc-entries'.  This element contains one or more `entries'
elements, one for each directory entry.  The first `entry' element is
the this dir entry with values for the directory containing this admin
area.

The `entry' element is empty and has the attributes described below.

an attribute may be boolean, in which case it can have one of the
values `true' or `false'.  Boolean attributes default to `false' if
not present.  Tiestamps are stored in the format produced by
svn_time_to_cstring().

`name':
   The basename of this entry; the empty string for the this dir
   entry.  Required for all entries.

`revision':
   The revision that the pristine text and properties of this entry
   represent.
   Defaults to the revision of the this dir entry, for which it is
   required.  Set to 0 for entries not yet in the repository.

`url':
   The URL of the corresponding entry in the repository.  Defaults to
   the URL of the this dir entry with the URI-encoded basename of this
   entry appended as a path segment.  Required for the this dir entry.

`repos':
   The prefix of the URL which represents the repository root of this
   entry.  Defaults to the repository root of the this dir entry.
   Optional for the this dir entry, for compatibility.

`kind':
   The kind of this entry: `file' or `dir'.  Required for all entries. 

`text-time':
   For file entries, the timestamp of the working file when it was
   last known to be identical to the text base file.  No default; optional.

`prop-time':
   Not used anymore.  In format 5 and earlier this was similar to
   `text-time', but for the working props file.

`checksum':
   For file entries, base-64 encoded MD5 checksum of the text-base
   file.  Optional, for backwards compatibility.

`schedule':
   The current scheduling for this entry: `add', `delete' or
   `replace'.  Defaults to normal scheduling.

`copied':
   A boolean: true if this entry was added with history; only allowed
   when schedule is add.  (### Why aren't the copyfrom attributes
   enough for this?)

`deleted':
   A boolean: true if this entry is deleted in its revision but exists
   in its parent's revision.  (### Add a sentence explaining why
   this is necessary.)

`absent':
   A boolean: true if is an entry by this name in the repository but
   we don't know anything about it except its kind.

`copyfrom-url':
   If this entry is added with history, the URL of the copy source.
   May be present iff `copyfrom-rev' is present.

`copyfrom-rev':
   If this entry is added with history, the revision of the copy
   source.  May be present iff `copyfrom-url' is present.

`conflict-old', `conflict-new' and `conflict-wrk':
   In case of a text conflict, these three attributes specify the relative
   filenames of the three saved conflict files.  No defaults;
   optional.

`prop-reject-file':
   In case of a property conflict, this specifies the relative
   filename of the property reject file.  Optional, no default.

`committed-rev':
   The last committed revision for this entry if this entry is in the
   repository.  NO default; optional.

`committed-date':
   The date of the `committed-rev' if available.  No default;
   optional.

`last-author':
   The author of the `committed-rev' if available.  No default;
   optional.

`uuid':
   The repository UUID of this entry.  Defaults to the UUID of the
   this dir entry.  Optional for the this dir entry, for backwards
   compatibility.

`incomplete':
   A boolean: true if this entries file is not complete yet.  Used
   when updating.  This is only allowed on the this dir entry.  (###
   Explain this in more detail.)

`lock-token':
   The lock token URL if this entry is locked in the repository.  No
   default; optional.

`lock-owner':
   The lock owner, iff there is a lock token.  No default; optional.

`lock-comment':
   The lock comment iff there is a lock token and the lock has a
   comment.  No default; optional.

`lock-creation-date':
   The lock creation date iff there is a lock token.  No default;
   optional.

`has-props':
   A boolean: for format 6 and later, true if there are any working
   properties for this entry.

`has-prop-mods':
   A boolean: for format 6 and later, true if this entry has any
   property modifications.

`cachable-props':
   For format 6 and later, a space-separated list of property names
   whose presence is cached in `present-props'.  Defaults to the value
   of the this dir entry.  For the this dir entry, defaults to the
   empty list.

`present-props':
   For format 6 and later, a space-separated list of property names.
   If a property name n is in this list, then the working props of
   this entry contains this property.  If `cachable-props' contains a
   property name n' but n' is absent from `present-props', then the
   working props don't contain this property.  Defaults to the empty
   list.

The only attributes allowed in an entry for a directory (other than
the this dir entry) are `name', `absent', `deleted', `schedule', `copied',
`copyfrom-url', `copyfrom-rev'.  The other attributes are only stored in
the this dir entry for the directory in question.


Property storage
----------------

For each entry, there may be one base and one working properties file.
For files, these are named .svn/prop-base/foo.svn-base and
.svn/props/foo.svn-work, respectively.  For directories, these are
stored directly under .svn in .svn/dir-prop-base and .svn/dir-props,
respectively.  Property files are in the hashdump format produced by
svn_hash_write().  If the file contains no properties, it is either
empty or contains just the "END\n" delimiter.  The way properties are
stored changed in format 6; the current way is described first.

In format 6 and later, the base-props file is present only if there
are any base properties.  The working props file is present only if
the entry has property modifications (i.e. it's `has-prop-mods'
attribute is true).  Note that an existing, but empty working props
file means that there are property modifications, but no working
properties.

In formats 5 and earlier, base-props are handled the same, but a
non-existent working props file is equivalent to an empty file and the
working props file always contains the working properties.  The
`prop-time' attribute can be used to optimize detection of property
modifications.

wcprops are stored in a similar fashion to how base-props are stored,
but they use .svn/dir-wcprops and .svn/wcprops/foo.svn-work names for
directory and file properties, respectively.


How the client applies an update delta
--------------------------------------

Updating is more than just bringing changes down from the repository;
it's also folding those changes into the working copy.  Getting the
right changes is the easy part -- folding them in is hard.

Before we examine how Subversion handles this, let's look at what CVS
does:

   1. Unmodified portions of the working copy are simply brought
      up-to-date.  The server sends a forward diff, the client applies
      it.

   2. Locally modified portions are "merged", where possible.  That
      is, the changes from the repository are incorporated into the
      local changes in an intelligent way (if the diff application
      succeeds, then no conflict, else go to 3...)

   3. Where merging is not possible, a conflict is flagged, and *both*
      sides of the conflict are folded into the local file in such a
      way that it's easy for the developer to figure out what
      happened.  (And the old locally-modified file is saved under a
      temp name, just in case.)

It would be nice for Subversion to do things this way too;
unfortunately, that's not possible in every case.

CVS has a wonderfully simplifying limitation: it doesn't version
directories, so never has tree-structure conflicts.  Given that only
textual conflicts are possible, there is usually a natural way to
express both sides of a conflict -- just include the opposing texts
inside the file, delimited with conflict markers.  (Or for binary
files, make both revisions available under temporary names.)

While Subversion can behave the same way for textual conflicts, the
situation is more complex for trees.  There is sometimes no way for a
working copy to reflect both sides of a tree conflict without being
more confusing than helpful.  How does one put "conflict markers" into
a directory, especially when what was a directory might now be a file,
or vice-versa?

Therefore, while Subversion does everything it can to fold conflicts
intelligently (doing at least as well as CVS does), in extreme cases
it is acceptable for the Subversion client to punt, saying in effect
"Your working copy is too out of whack; please move it aside, check
out a fresh one, redo your changes in the fresh copy, and commit from
that."  (This response may also apply to subtrees of the working copy,
of course).

Usually it offers more detail than that, too.  In addition to the
overall out-of-whackness message, it can say "Directory foo was
renamed to bar, conflicting with your new file bar; file blah was
deleted, conflicting with your local change to file blah, ..." and so
on.  The important thing is that these are informational only -- they
tell the user what's wrong, but they don't try to fix it
automatically.

All this is purely a matter of *client-side* intelligence.  Nothing in
the repository logic or protocol affects the client's ability to fold
conflicts.  So as we get smarter, and/or as there is demand for more
informative conflicting updates, the client's behavior can improve and
punting can become a rare event.  We should start out with a _simple_
conflict-folding algorithm initially, though.


Text and Property Components
----------------------------

A Subversion working copy keeps track of *two* forks per file, much
like the way MacOS files have "data" forks and "resource" forks.  Each
file under revision control has its "text" and "properties" tracked
with different timestamps and different conflict (reject) files.  In
this vein, each file's status-line has two columns which describe the
file's state.

Examples:

  --  glub.c      --> glub.c is completely up-to-date.
  U-  foo.c       --> foo.c's textual component was updated.
  -M  bar.c       --> bar.c's properties have been locally modified
  UC  baz.c       --> baz.c has had both components patched, but a
                      local property change is creating a conflict.
