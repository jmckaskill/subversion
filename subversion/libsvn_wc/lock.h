/* Take out a write-lock, stealing an existing lock if one exists.  This
   function avoids the potential race between checking for an existing lock
   and creating a lock. The cleanup code uses this function, but stealing
   locks is not a good idea because the code cannot determine whether a
   lock is still in use. Try not to write any more code that requires this
   feature. 

   PATH is the directory to lock, and the lock is returned in
   *ADM_ACCESS.  ASSOCIATED can be another lock in which case the locks
   will be in the same set, or it can be NULL.
