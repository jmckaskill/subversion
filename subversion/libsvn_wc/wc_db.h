 * ###
 * ### Suppose you check out a symlink on platform X and platform Y.
 * ### X supports symlinks; Y does not.  Should the wc-ng storage for

 * ### of odd for the wc-ng storage for that file to be of a different
 * ### type from all the other files.  (On the other hand, maybe it's
 * ### weird today that the wc-1 storage for a working symlink is to
 * ### be like a regular file (i.e., regular text-base and whatnot).
 * ###
 * ### I'm still feeling my way around this problem; just pointing out
 * ### the issues.
 *
 * ### gjs: symlinks are stored in the database as first-class objects,
 * ###   rather than in the filesystem as "special" regular files. thus,
 * ###   all portability concerns are moot. higher-levels can figure out
 * ###   how to represent the link in ACTUAL. higher-levels can also
 * ###   deal with translating to/from the svn:special property and

/** Scan upwards for additional information about a WORKING node.
 *
 * A WORKING node's status, as returned from svn_wc__db_read_info() can be
 * one of three states:
 *   svn_wc__db_status_added
 *   svn_wc__db_status_deleted
 *   svn_wc__db_status_incomplete
 *
 * (the "normal" and absent statuses only refer to unshadowed BASE nodes)
 *
 * If the node is in the "added" state, then this function can refine that
 * status into one of three possible states:
 *
 *   svn_wc__db_status_added -- this NODE is a simple add without history.
 *     OP_ROOT_ABSPATH will be set to the topmost node in the added subtree
 *     (implying its parent will be an unshadowed BASE node). The REPOS_*
 *     values will be implied by that ancestor BASE node and this node's
 *     position in the added subtree. ORIGINAL_* will be set to their
 *     NULL values (and SVN_INVALID_REVNUM for ORIGINAL_REVISION). The
 *     MOVED_TO_ABSPATH will be set to NULL.
 *
 *   svn_wc__db_status_copied -- this NODE is the root or child of a copy.
 *     The root of the copy will be stored in OP_ROOT_ABSPATH. Note that
 *     the parent of the operation root could be another WORKING node (from
 *     an add, copy, or move). The REPOS_* values will be implied by the
 *     ancestor unshadowed BASE node. ORIGINAL_* will indicate the source
 *     of the copy, and MOVED_TO_ABSPATH will be set to NULL.
 *
 *   svn_wc__db_status_move_dst -- this NODE arrived as a result of a move.
 *     The root of the moved nodes will be stored in OP_ROOT_ABSPATH.
 *     Similar to the copied state, its parent may be a WORKING node or a
 *     BASE node. And again, the REPOS_* values are implied by this node's
 *     position in the subtree under the ancestor unshadowed BASE node.
 *     ORIGINAL_* will indicate the source of the move, and MOVED_TO_ABSPATH
 *     will be set to NULL.
 *
 * If the node is in the "deleted" state, then this function can refine
 * the status into one of two possible states:
 *
 *   svn_wc__db_status_deleted -- this NODE is part of a normal delete.
 *     OP_ROOT_ABSPATH will be set to the topmost node in the deleted
 *     subtree. That node's parent may be another WORKING node, or a BASE
 *     node. The REPOS_*, ORIGINAL_*, and MOVED_TO_ABSPATH (OUT) parameters
 *     will be set to NULL.
 *
 *   svn_wc__db_status_move_src -- this NODE was moved elsewhere. The root
 *     of the moved tree will be set in OP_ROOT_ABSPATH. That node's parent
 *     may be a WORKING or a BASE node. MOVED_TO_ABSPATH will be set to
 *     the destination of the move (note that further operations may have
 *     been performed on it at its new location; it is not a given that the
 *     node is still present in that location). The REPOS_* and ORIGINAL_*
 *     parameters will be set to NULL.
 *
 * All OUT parameters may be set to NULL to indicate a lack of interest in
 * that piece of information.
 *
 * ORIGINAL_REPOS_RELPATH will refer to the *root* of the operation. It
 * does *not* correspond to the node given by LOCAL_RELPATH. The caller
 * can use the suffix on LOCAL_ABSPATH (relative to OP_ROOT_ABSPATH) in
 * order to compute the corresponding source node.
 *
 * All returned data will be allocated in RESULT_POOL. All temporary
 * allocations will be made in SCRATCH_POOL.
