/* We can handle this format or anything lower, and we (should) error

 *
 * The change from 1 to 2 was the introduction of SVN_WC__WORK_EXT.
 * For example, ".svn/props/foo" became ".svn/props/foo.svn-work".
 *
 * The change from 2 to 3 was the introduction of the entry attribute

 *
 * The change from 3 to 4 was the renaming of the magic "svn:this_dir"

 *
 * The change from 4 to 5 was the addition of support for replacing files
 * with history.
 *
 * The change from 5 to 6 was the introduction of caching of property

 *
 * The change from 6 to 7 was changing the entries file format from XML.
 *
 * The change from 7 to 8 was putting wcprops in one file per directory.
