/* We can handle this format or anything lower, and we (should) error
 * on anything higher.
 *
 * There is no format version 0; we started with 1.
 *
 * The change from 1 to 2 was the introduction of the ".svn-work" extension.
 * For example, ".svn/props/foo" became ".svn/props/foo.svn-work".
 *
 * The change from 2 to 3 was the introduction of the entry attribute
 * old-and-busted.c::ENTRIES_ATTR_ABSENT.
 *
 * The change from 3 to 4 was the renaming of the magic "svn:this_dir"
 * entry name to "".
 *
 * == 1.0.x shipped with format 4
 * == 1.1.x shipped with format 4
 * == 1.2.x shipped with format 4
 * == 1.3.x shipped with format 4
 *
 * The change from 4 to 5 was the addition of support for replacing files
 * with history (the "revert base"). This was introduced in 1.4.0, but
 # buggy until 1.4.6.
 *
 * The change from 5 to 6 was the introduction of caching of property
 * modification state and certain properties in the entries file.
 *
 * The change from 6 to 7 was changing the entries file format from XML.
 *
 * The change from 7 to 8 was putting wcprops in one file per directory.
 *
 * == 1.4.x shipped with format 8
 *
 * The change from 8 to 9 was the addition of changelists, keep-local,
 * and sticky depth (for selective/sparse checkouts).
 *
 * == 1.5.x shipped with format 9
 *
 * The change from 9 to 10 was the addition of tree-conflicts, file
 * externals and a different canonicalization of urls.
 *
 * == 1.6.x shipped with format 10
 *
 * The change from 10 to 11 was clearing the has_props, has_prop_mods,
 * cachable_props, and present_props values in the entries file. Older
 * client expect proper values for these fields.
 *
 * The change from 11 to 12 was a switch from 'entries' to 'wc.db'.
 *
 * The change from 12 to 13 added the WORK_QUEUE table into 'wc.db', moved
 * the wcprops into the 'dav_cache' column in BASE_NODE, and stopped using
 * the 'incomplete_children' column of BASE_NODE.
 *
 * The change from 13 to 14 added the WCLOCKS table (and migrated locks
 * from the filesystem into wc.db), and some columns to ACTUAL_NODE for
 * future use.
 *
 * The change from 14 to 15 switched from depth='exclude' on directories to
 * using presence='exclude' within the BASE_NODE and WORKING_NODE tables.
 * This change also enabled exclude support on files and symlinks.
 *
 * The change from 15 to 16 added 'locked_levels' to WC_LOCK, setting
 * any existing locks to a level of 0. The 'md5_checksum' column was
 * added to PRISTINE for future use.
 *
 * The change from 16 to 17 added a '.svn/pristine' dir and moved the text
 * bases into the Pristine Store (the PRISTINE table and '.svn/pristine'
 * dir), and removed the '/.svn/text-base' dir.
 *
 * The change from 17 to 18 moved the properties from separate files in the
 * props and prop-base directory (and .svn for the dir itself) into the
 * wc.db file, and then removes the props and prop-base dir.
 *
 * The change from 18 to 19 introduces the 'single DB' per working copy.
 * All metadata is held in a single '.svn/wc.db' in the root directory of
 * the working copy.
 *
 * The change from 19 to 20 introduces NODES and drops BASE_NODE and
 * WORKING_NODE, op_depth is always 0 or 2. 
 *
 * The change from 20 to 21 moved tree conflict storage from the
 * parent to the conflicted node.
 *
 * The change from 21 to 22 moved tree conflict storage from
 * conflict_data column to the tree_conflict_data column.
 *
 * The change from 22 to 23 introduced multi-layer op_depth processing for
 * NODES.
 *
 * == 1.7.x shipped with format ???
 *
 * Please document any further format changes here.
