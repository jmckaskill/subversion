/* Modify the entry of working copy PATH, presumably after an update
   completes.   If PATH doesn't exist, this routine does nothing.
   ADM_ACCESS must be an access baton for PATH (assuming it existed).

   Set the entry's 'url' and 'working revision' fields to BASE_URL and
   NEW_REVISION.  If BASE_URL is null, the url field is untouched; if
   NEW_REVISION in invalid, the working revision field is untouched.
   The modifications are mutually exclusive.

   If REPOS is non-NULL, set the repository root of the entry to REPOS, but
   only if REPOS is an ancestor of the entries URL (after possibly modifying
   it).  IN addition to that requirement, if the PATH refers to a directory,
   the repository root is only set if REPOS is an ancestor of the URLs all
   file entries which don't already have a repository root set.  This prevents
   the entries file from being corrupted by this operation.

   If PATH is a directory, then, walk entries below PATH according to
   DEPTH thusly:

   If DEPTH is svn_depth_infinity, perform the following actions on
   every entry below PATH; if svn_depth_immediates, svn_depth_files,
   or svn_depth_empty, perform them only on PATH:

   If NEW_REVISION is valid, then tweak every entry to have this new
   working revision (excluding files that are scheduled for addition
   or replacement.)  Likewise, if BASE_URL is non-null, then rewrite
   all urls to be "telescoping" children of the base_url.

   ### TODO(sd): See README.branch about depth behavior above!

   If REMOVE_MISSING_DIRS is TRUE, then delete the entries for any 
   missing directories.  If NOTIFY_FUNC is non-null, invoke it with 
   NOTIFY_BATON for each missing entry deleted.

   EXCLUDE_PATHS is a hash containing const char * pathnames.  Entries
   for pathnames contained in EXCLUDE_PATHS are not touched by this
   function.
