/*
 * This code uses an svn_delta_edit_fns_t editor driven by
 * svn_wc_crawl_revisions (like the update command) to retrieve the
 * differences between the working copy and the requested repository
 * version. Rather than updating the working copy, this new editor creates
 * temporary files that contain the pristine repository versions. When the
 * crawler closes the files the editor calls back to a client layer
 * function to compare the working copy and the temporary file. There is
 * only ever one temporary file in existence at any time.
 *
 * When the crawler closes a directory, the editor then calls back to the
 * client layer to compare any remaining files that may have been modified
 * locally. Added directories do not have corresponding temporary
 * directories created, as they are not needed.
 *
 * ### TODO: It might be better if the temporary files were not created in
 * the admin's temp area, but in a more general area (/tmp, $TMPDIR) as
 * then diff could be run on a read-only working copy.
 *
 * ### TODO: Replacements where the node kind changes needs support. It
 * mostly works when the change is in the repository, but not when it is
 * in the working copy.
 *
 * ### TODO: Do we need to support copyfrom?
