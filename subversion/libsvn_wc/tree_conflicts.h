/*
 * See the notes/tree-conflicts/ directory for more information
 * about tree conflicts in general.
 *
 * A given directory may contain potentially many tree conflicts.
 * Each tree conflict is identified by the path of the file
 * or directory (both a.k.a node) that it affects.
 * We call this file or directory the "victim" of the tree conflict.
 *
 * For example, a file that is deleted by an update but locally
 * modified by the user is a victim of a tree conflict.
 *
 * For now, tree conflict victims are always direct children of the
 * directory in which the tree conflict is recorded.
 * This may change once the way Subversion handles adm areas changes.
 *
 * If a directory has tree conflicts, the "tree-conflict-data" field
 * in the entry for the directory contains one or more tree conflict
 * descriptions.
 *
 * Each tree conflict description contains several fields,
 * separated by the following character:
 */

#define SVN_WC__TREE_CONFLICT_DESC_FIELD_SEPARATOR ':'

/*
 * The fields are:
 *
 *  victim_path:node_kind:operation:action:reason
 *
 * None of these fields are null-terminated.
 * None of these fields can be empty.
 *
 * The victim_path field stores the path of the tree conflict victim,
 * and corresponds to the 'path' field in svn_wc_conflict_description_t.
 *
 * The node_kind field indicates the node kind of the victim, and
 * corresponds to the node_kind field in svn_wc_conflict_description_t.
 *
 * The operation field represents the svn operation that exposed the
 * tree conflict, and corresponds to the operation field in
 * svn_wc_conflict_description_t.
 *
 * The action field describes the action which the operation
 * attempted to carry out on the victim, and corresponds to
 * the same field in svn_wc_conflict_description_t.
 *
 * The reason field describes the local change which contradicts
 * with the action. It corresponds to the same field in
 * svn_wc_conflict_description_t.
 */

/* 
 * When multiple tree conflict descriptions are present in an entry,
 * they are separated by the following character:
 */

#define SVN_WC__TREE_CONFLICT_DESC_SEPARATOR '|'

/*
 * Here is an example entry with two tree conflicts:
 *
 *   foo.c:file:update:deleted:edited|bar.h:file:update:edited:deleted
 */
 
/*
 * If the field separator occurs in the victim_path, it must be escaped
 * with the following character:
 */

#define SVN_WC__TREE_CONFLICT_ESCAPE_CHAR '\\'

/* 
 * Likewise, if a description separator character is present in the
 * victim_path, it must also escaped. A literal escape character
 * occurring in the victim_path must also be escaped.
 *
 * The escaping conventions mentioned in subversion/libsvn_wc/README
 * also apply, but are transparent to the tree conflicts code.
