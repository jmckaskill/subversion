/* Set *RESULT_ABSPATH to the absolute path to a readable file containing
   the pristine text of LOCAL_ABSPATH in DB, or to NULL if it does not have
   any pristine text.

   If USE_BASE is FALSE it gets the pristine text of what is currently in the
   working copy. (So it returns the pristine file of a copy).

   If USE_BASE is TRUE, it looks in the lowest layer of the working copy and
   shows exactly what was originally checked out (or updated to).

   Rationale:

   Which text-base do we want to use for the diff?  If the node is replaced
   by a new file, then the base of the replaced file is called (in WC-1) the
   "revert base".  If the replacement is a copy or move, then there is also
   the base of the copied file to consider.

   One could argue that we should never diff against the revert
   base, and instead diff against the empty-file for both types of
   replacement.  After all, there is no ancestry relationship
   between the working file and the base file.  But my guess is that
   in practice, users want to see the diff between their working
   file and "the nearest versioned thing", whatever that is.  I'm
   not 100% sure this is the right decision, but it at least seems
   to match our test suite's expectations. */
