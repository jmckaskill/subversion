/* Hash table for vdelta hashing.

   Each hash bucket is a chain of slots. The index of the slot in
   the slots array is also the index of the key string in the
   current window's data stream. The hash table implements a multimap
   (i.e., hash and key collisions are allowed).

   To store a key->index mapping, just add slot[index] to the slot
   chain tn key's bucket (see store_mapping).

   For a given key, you can traverse the list of match candidates (some
   of which may be hash collisions) like this:

   for (slot = buckets[get_bucket(key)]; slot != NULL; slot = slot->next)
     {
       index = slot - slots;
       ...
     }

  This hash table implementation os based on the description in
  http://subversion.tigris.org/subversion-dev/current/msg00152.html. */

/* Vdelta generator.

   The article "Delta Algorithms: An Empirical Analysis" by Hunt,
   Vo and Tichy contains a description of the vdelta algorithm,
   but it's incomplete. Here's a detailed description (see also
   http://subversion.tigris.org/subversion-dev/current/msg00158.html
   in the mailing list archives):
   
     1. Look up the four bytes starting at the current position
        pointer.  If there are no matches for those four bytes,
        output an insert, move the position pointer forward by one,
        and go back to step 1.

     2. Determine which of the candidates yields the longest
        extension.  This will be called the "current match".

     3. Look up the last three bytes of the current match plus one
        unmatched byte.  If there is no match for those four bytes,
        the current match is the best match; go to step 6.

     4. For each candidate, check backwards to see if it matches
        the entire match so far.  If no candidates satisfy that
        constraint, the current match is the best match; go to step 6.

     5. Among the candidates which do satisfy the constraint,
        determine which one yields the longest extension.  This
        will be the new "current match."  Go back to step 3.

     6. Output a block copy instruction, add indexes for the last
        three positions of the matched data, advance the position
        pointer by the length of the match, and go back to step 1.

   Inserts and copies are generated only when the current position
   is within the target data.

   Note that the vdelta algorithm allows copies that cross the
   source/target data boundary. Because our internal delta
   representation has different opcodes for source and terget copies,
   we split them in two. This means that the opcode stream in the
   delta window can contain copies shorter than VD_KEY_SIZE. These
   could be represented by insert ops instead, but we'll leave them
   in, so that we can merge them again when we convert the delta
   window to an external format like vcdiff that supports cross
   -boundary copies. */
