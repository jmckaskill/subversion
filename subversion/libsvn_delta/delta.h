 * example, if an ancestor is omitted, it means the same path at the
 * same revision (taken from the surrounding delta context).  We may
 * well decide to use corresponding optimizations here -- an absent
 * svn_ancestor_t object means use the path and ancestor from the
 * delta, etc -- or we may not.  In any case it doesn't affect the
 * definitions of these data structures.  However, once we do know

 * doesn't wait for an entire 200 meg tree delta to arrive before

 * The delta being {de}constructed is passed along as one of the
 * arguments to the XML parser callbacks; the callbacks use the
 * existing delta, plus whatever the parser just saw that caused the
 * callback to be invoked, to figure out what to do next.
