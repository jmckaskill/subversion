/* 

  The property-parsing system is modeled closely after the
  vcdiff-parser API, except that it has two alternate modes of
  operation.  If the caller sets apply_*_propchange in the walker,
  then we buffer and send off the entire* propchange in RAM.  If the
  caller gives us an svn_prop_change_chunk_handler_t, however, then it
  wants the propchange streamed in a chunky way, just like text
  deltas.  These two methods are *not* mutually exclusive.  

   NOTE that (at least in this model), our parser creates a new APR
   sub-pool to buffer each incoming window of data.  It then passes
   this window off to the consumer routine, and creates a *new*
   sub-pool to start buffering again.  It's the consumer routine's
   responsibility to free the sub-pool (when it's finished with it) by
   calling svn_free_delta_chunk().
