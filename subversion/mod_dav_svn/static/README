DIRECTORY: mod_dav_svn/static/

This directory contains a few files that are required for building
mod_dav_svn as a static module, linked directly into Apache.

    Makefile.in -- standard Makefile template for an Apache module

    config.m4   -- autoconf configuration specific to mod_dav_svn.
                   This is actually a very specialized module
                   (omitting much of the standard Apache config
                   framework for modules). We don't want to actually
                   build anything within the Apache directory -- will
                   build within SVN and simply link it into the Apache
                   executable).

During "installation", these files will be copied into the Apache 2.0
source tree.

When Apache's APXS is used to build a dynamically-loaded module, these 
files will be ignored.
