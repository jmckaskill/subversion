/* SPECIAL URI

   SVN needs to create many types of "pseudo resources" -- resources
   that don't correspond to the users' files/directories in the
   repository. Specifically, these are:

   - working resources
   - activities
   - version resources
   - version history resources

   Each of these will be placed under a portion of the URL namespace
   that defines the SVN repository. For example, let's say the user
   has configured an SVN repository at http://host/svn/repos. The
   special resources could be configured to live at .../!svn/ under
   that repository. Thus, an activity might be located at
   http://host/svn/repos/!svn/act/1234.

   The special URI is configurable on a per-server basis and defaults
   to "!svn".

   NOTE: the special URI is RELATIVE to the "root" of the
   repository. The root is generally available only to
   dav_svn_get_resource(). This is okay, however, because we can cache
   the root_dir when the resource structure is built.
