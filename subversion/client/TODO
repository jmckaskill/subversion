Scratch space for client work.


Fitz TODO:

- Fix propset --val-file problem
- Once over cmds, check args against README and get cleaning
- Document cmd structure
- Dive into commit and checkout in libsvn_client



Some notes on a subset of the client commands. These are the basics
that we're working on right now. Note that non-file args don't count
standard flags that are dealt with by get_opts.

COMMAND         # of non-file args      # of file args  
annotate        0                       0, 1, or more (implicit dot) 
commit          0                       0, 1, or more (implicit dot) 
delete          0                       1, or more
status          0                       0, 1, or more (implicit dot) 
update          0                       0, 1, or more (implicit dot) 
log             0                       0, 1, or more (implicit dot) 
diff            !                       0, 1, or more (implicit dot) 
propget         1                       0, 1, or more (implicit dot) 
propset         2                       0, 1, or more (implicit dot) 
add             0                       1 or more
checkout        1 or more               0
import          3                       0

So the mechanism that we currently have in place will handle
everything except for diff, which will likely have to be special cased
anyway since it's going to deal with (possibly, hopefully) many
different external diff programs.
