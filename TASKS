These are tasks that break down along clean interface boundaries --
everything here will get done eventually, but volunteers will make it
happen faster! :-)  Please email dev@subversion.tigris.org if you want
to take something on.

1. CVS->SVN repository conversion program (or script, whatever).
   Bob Miller <kbob@jogger-egg.com> is working on this, see
   tools/cvs2svn/.


2. Hook up libsvn_client w/ libsvn_ra_dav.


3. Split XML file handling out of libsvn_client. That stuff should go
   into libsvn_ra_xml since it is (effectively) a different repository 
   type for patches, commits, etc.

   libsvn_client would then select the appropriate RA layer
   (libsvn_ra_dav, libsvn_ra_xml, or libsvn_ra_local) depending upon
   the desired operation.


4. Macintosh/Windows/Unix GUI clients.

   Once libsvn_client API is finalized (which, for a sufficiently
   loose definition of "final", should be by Milestone 2 on April 1st),
   it will be usable by any client, not just the command-line client.

   I'm not sure this argues definitively for native clients written in
   C for Mac and Windows, though that's certainly one way to get it
   done.  Perhaps one client could be written for both platforms,
   using a Java class that links to the C libsvn_client API?

   Volunteers / interested parties:
   	  KDE/QT: Kevin Pilch-Bisson
	  Java:	  Kevin Pilch-Bisson, maybe, if someone else does Java bindings :)

5. Language bindings to the Subversion libraries.

   Volunteers / interested parties:

      Python: Lefty, GJS
      Perl: Jens Klocker
      Guile: JimB
      Tcl: Mo DeJong
      Ruby: Julian Fitzell
      Java: Daniel Rall

   Note: names can/should be added to the above. If you're interested,
   then let us know, so we can add your name. The above list is
   certainly not intended to be the only people to work on these, but
   mainly as a way to verify that we have full coverage.
