These are tasks that break down along clean interface boundaries --
everything here will get done eventually, but volunteers will make it
happen faster! :-)  Please email dev@subversion.tigris.org if you want
to take something on.

1. CVS->SVN repository conversion program (or script, whatever).
   Bob Miller <kbob@jogger-egg.com> is working on this, see
   tools/cvs2svn/.


2. Hook up libsvn_client w/ libsvn_ra_dav.


3. Split XML file handling out of libsvn_client. That stuff should go
   into libsvn_ra_xml since it is (effectively) a different repository 
   type for patches, commits, etc.

   libsvn_client would then select the appropriate RA layer
   (libsvn_ra_dav, libsvn_ra_xml, or libsvn_ra_local) depending upon
   the desired operation.
