This branch exists to prepare implementation of the repository access
APIs with JavaHL. It is being managed as a reintegrate-able branch, with 
catch-up merges from the trunk.

TODO:

   * Prepare existing code for merging of SVNRa editor       [COMPLETED]
   
      01. JavaHL: Changed return value from the 
          java svn_stream_t read function to be compatible 
          with the txdelta_next_window function              [trunk@1342720]
          
      02. JavaHL: Explicitly pass jobject jthis when 
          processing dispose() call rather Â than stashing a
          reference in the SVNBase class where it can be 
          misused later                                      [trunk@1342810]
          
      03. JavaHL: Add SVN_JNI_STRING macro to reduce amount
          of code necessary to declare JNIStringHolder and
          check for exceptions                               [POSTPONED]
          
      04. JavaHL: New method for creating java objects
          linked to their C++ counterpart                    [br.@1352400]   
          
      05. JavaHL: Factored out common context for later use
          by SVNRa class                                     [br.@1352403]
          
      06. JavaHL: Minimal implementation of SVNRa:
          getLatestRevision()                                [br.@1352419]
          
      07. JavaHL: Merge existing SVNRepoAccess into SVNRa    [br.@1352737]

      08. JavaHL: Move logic from JNI wrapper methods into
          their C++ counterparts for consistency with the 
          rest of the code                                   [br.@1353373]

      09. JavaHL: Switch getDatedRevision from Date to long
           to avoid issue #2359                              [br.@1353376]

          
   * Implement other ra functions not requiring additional
     code refactoring                                        [IN PROGRESS]
      
      10. JavaHL: Implement getUUID()                        [br.@1353377]

      11. JavaHL: Implement getUrl()                         [br.@1353380]

      12. JavaHL: Implement reparent()                       [IN PROGRESS]

      13. JavaHL: Implement getRoot()                        [IN PROGRESS]

      14. JavaHL: Implement setProgressCallback()            [IN PROGRESS]


   * Apply editor support patches                            [IN PROGRESS]
      xx. JavaHL: Support returning non const, empty rather
          than NULL hash as required by 
          (svn_ra_get_commit_editor3) 
          apr_hash_t *revprop_table parameter                [br.@1343456 TBR]
          
      xx. JavaHL: Support keeping global reference to the
          callback java object as required by the RA API due
          to callback being used across method calls         [IN REVIEW]
          
      xx. JavaHL: Added support for creating of svn_string_t
          from JNIByteArray                                  [IN PROGRESS]
          
      xx. JavaHL: Added SVN_JNI_BYTE_ARRAY macro to reduce
          amount of duplicate code dealing with jbyteArray
          wrapper and checking for exceptions                [POSTPONED]
      
      xx. JavaHL: Factor out common java string map
          processing into StringsTable class from
          svn_string_t specific processing in the
          RevpropTable class                                 [IN PROGRESS]

     xx. JavaHL: Use static dump file in test so that 
         commit times and UUID properties can be tested      [TODO]

     xx. Make sure all functions declarations match 
         exceptions that can be thrown from them             [TODO]

     xx. Reparent() call with "BAD" url causes JVM to
         segfault                                            [TODO]

     xx. Document that SVNRa class is not part of public API
         only ISVNRa is                                      [TODO]
