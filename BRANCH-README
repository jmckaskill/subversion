This branch exists for the implementation of the svn bisect command.
It is maintained as a reintegrate-able branch with regular catch-up
merges from trunk.

PURPOSE
=======

For years, subversion users have used third-party scripts to do what
should rightfully be a part of subversion itself. This branch aims
to implement bisect functionality and make it available via the
public API.


SPEC
====

svn bisect start [-rN[:M]]

Initialize the bisection state.
If a state already exists, clean it up and create a fresh one.
If a revision range is specified, limit bisection to this range.
If a single revision is specified, bisect from that revision to HEAD.
If no revision is specified, bisect from revision 1 to HEAD.

svn bisect bad [-rN]

If used before "svn bisect run", mark the specified revision as "bad".

If used during interactive bisection, no revision should be specified.
The current revision is marked as "bad".

svn bisect good [-rN]

If used before "svn bisect run", mark the specified revision as
"good".

If used during interactive bisection, no revision should be
specified. The current revision is marked as "good".

svn bisect skip [-rN[:M]]

If specified before "svn bisect run", mark the specified revision or
revision range as "skip".

If used during the interactive bisection, the current revision will
be marked "skip", and a nearby revision will be chosen.
#TODO: How to choose the nearby revision?

svn bisect reset [-rN]

Update the working copy to the specified revision and clean the
bisection state. If no revision is specified, it takes the working
copy to the revision before "svn bisect start" was run.

svn bisect run [my_script [args]]

Start the bisection. If no script is given, start the bisect in
interactive mode. i.e after updating to a specific revision, wait 
for the user to manually run tests and mark the revision as good,
bad or skip.

The script should follow the following spec:

Good revision   : Exit Code 0
Bad revision    : Exit Code 1 thru 127 (except 125)
Skip revision   : Exit Code 125
Abort bisection : Any other Exit Code

The above mentioned exit codes conform to the way git bisect does
things.
