This branch exists to experiment with a common bindings object model, 
starting with implementing a C++ binding layer, and as described in
notes/object-model.txt.  It is hoped that this layer will serve as a base
for creating object-oriented bindings for other languages.

Currently, this is a "pie in the sky" idea, though, so I'm putting this work
on a branch, without any knowledge of how or when I'll continue working on it.

 * Short-term tasks:
   - Implement bindings for the following APIs in libsvn_client
     (these were not chosen arbitrarily, they represent all the
      non-deprecated APIs in the client library):
     * svn_client_version()
     * svn_client_checkout3()
     * svn_client_update3()
     * svn_client_switch2()
     * svn_client_add4()
     * svn_client_mkdir4()
     * svn_client_delete4()
     * svn_client_import4()
     * svn_client_commit5()
     * svn_client_status5()
     * svn_client_log5()
     * svn_client_blame5()
     * svn_client_diff5()
     * svn_client_diff_peg5()
     * svn_client_diff_summarize2()
     * svn_client_diff_summarize_peg2()
     * svn_client_merge3()
     * svn_client_merge_reintegrate()
     * svn_client_merge_peg3()
     * svn_client_suggest_merge_sources()
     * svn_client_mergeinfo_get_merged()
     * svn_client_mergeinfo_log()
     * svn_client_mergeinfo_log_merged()
     * svn_client_mergeinfo_log_eligible()
     * svn_client_cleanup()
     * svn_client_upgrade()
     * svn_client_relocate()
     * svn_client_revert2()
     * svn_client_resolve()
     * svn_client_copy6()
     * svn_client_move6()
     * svn_client_propset4()
     * svn_client_propget3()
     * svn_client_revprop_set2()
     * svn_client_proplist3()
     * svn_client_export5()
     * svn_client_list2()
     * svn_client_cat2()                            [DONE]
     * svn_client_add_to_changelist()
     * svn_client_remove_from_changelists()
     * svn_client_get_changelists()
     * svn_client_lock()
     * svn_client_unlock()
     * svn_client_info2()
     * svn_client_path()

 * Long-term tasks:
   - Documentation
   - Wrap with swig
   - Implement bindings for libraries other than libsvn_client
