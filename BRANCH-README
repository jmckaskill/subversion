This branch is for development towards a solution for Subversion issue
#2779[1] ("subversion does not support redirects").  It is being
maintained as a reintegrateable branch, with occasional syncs from
^/subversion/trunk.


APPROACH
========

The solution's approach is as follows:

  1. Teach the RA DAV providers to recognize 301 and 302 responses to
     the initial OPTIONS request they always perform as part of
     session opening and capabilities exchange.

       - ra_neon  [DONE]
       - ra_serf  [DONE]

  2. Rev svn_ra_open3(), teaching the new version to gracefully return
     the corrected URL provided by the server, while still allowing
     old versions to error out on redirections/relocations as they do
     today.  [DONE]

  3. Teach some subcommands to deal with corrected URLs from the 
     RA layer, relocating their targets as necessary.

       - checkout  [DONE]
       - update  [DONE]
       - switch

Then, either:

  4. Provide notification of redirection events to the user.  [DONE]

  5. Make the retry-on-corrected-URL event an optional behavior, tied
     to the particular server and defaulting to 'off', recognizing
     that there's a security element here (compromised server,
     redirecting folks to dangerous code, etc.)

or:

  4. Bind the retry-on-corrected-URL event to a prompting callback.


QUESTIONS
=========

  - Should only permanent relocations (301 Moved Permanently) be
    handled in this way?

  - Do we want run-time configuration for auto-relocation?
