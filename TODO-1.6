We are getting close to creating the 1.6.x branch.  This file lists the tasks
we want to complete before branching.  "Blocker" tasks must be done before we
branch, while "optional" tasks would be nice to have completed, but aren't
essential.

Tasks which need to happen before the 1.6.0 release, but aren't related to when
we branch should be put in the issue tracker with the 1.6 milestone.

Blocker:

 * #3334: Tree conflicts "merry-go-round" about update updating the base.
   Julian Foad is working on this. Done for when victim is a file, still
   doing for when victim is a directory.

 * #3343: Switch to skel for TC information, rather than using another
   serialization format. (Also listed under "Optional". Not really a blocker?)

 * Test failures in Ruby bindings.
 
 * r34977 added a cmdline prompt to a library function. This api should be
   updated to accept a prompt handler and svn should provide such a prompt
   handler.

Optional:

 * Merge the sparse-directories deselection branch, as noted by kfogel:
   http://svn.haxx.se/dev/archive-2008-10/1001.shtml

 * Tree conflicts - essential issues:

   - #3209: Tests XFAIL due to changed tree-conflicts behaviour

 * Tree conflicts - non-essential issues:

   - #3329: Update/switch fails if the target itself is a tree conflict victim.
     Should print a 'Skipped' message instead.  Update of an item that is
     inside a tree conflict, and that no longer exists in the repo, does
     nothing.  Should print a 'Skipped' message instead.

   - #3343: Making use of skels to store tree conflict data in entries file

     IRC conversation excerpts:
     <stsp> gstein, made up your mind about skels yet?
     <gstein> yeah. skels are all-ascii, so they'll work just fine in entries
     <gstein> two files to move to libsvn_subr
     <stsp> that was the only other tc-blocking issue I can remember
     <stsp> but the code as-is is working fine and has been tested for more
            than half a year
     <gstein> stsp: and the skel code works and has been tested for 8 years
     [...]
     <gstein> anyways, I do agree/believe that the code is solid,
     <stsp> well, I'm still not entirely convince the extra effort of changing
            the code to use skels is really worth it, but we'll see --
            I'd still say solve the other issues first, and convert to skels
            then if time is left
     <gstein> but it is more code to support over the long haul
     <gstein> the "read" code has to exist forever
     <stsp> yes
     <stsp> till 2.0
     <gstein> right
     <stsp> I don't mind maintaining the read code :)
     <gstein> I'd prefer that we don't have to carry it around
     <gstein> haha
     <gstein> well, the community has to maintain it
     <gstein> oh. what I was about to say, is that I'm leaving in 2 hrs,
     <gstein> but will work on skel'ing the code when I get home
     <stsp> right
     <gstein> I'll make the skels svn-private in trunk,
     <gstein> and then do the skel work on a branch for eval
     <stsp> that's fine -- I'm just objected to taking tc-focused resources
            away for skels from other things
     <stsp> if you do it, +1
     <gstein> well, I can more or less buy the "will only have to leave
              read code" argument,
     <gstein> so it is hard to strenuously object and maintain my -1,
     <gstein> so I'm good with doing the work myself
     <gstein> my wc work isn't going to be done for 1.6, so distraction
              is fine :-P
