We are getting close to creating the 1.6.x branch.  This file lists the tasks
we want to complete before branching.  "Blocker" tasks must be done before we
branch, while "optional" tasks would be nice to have completed, but aren't
essential.

Tasks which need to happen before the 1.6.0 release, but aren't related to when
we branch should be put in the issue tracker with the 1.6 milestone.

Blocker:

 * #3334: Tree conflicts "merry-go-round" about update updating the base.
   Julian Foad is working on this. Done for when victim is a file, still
   doing for when victim is a directory.  [julianfoad]
   See: <http://subversion.tigris.org/ds/viewMessage.do?dsForumId=462&dsMessageId=1019712>.

 * Review the new "svn_dirent/svn_uri" API and ensure we aren't putting
   functions into the public name space that we won't want to support.
   See <http://subversion.tigris.org/ds/viewMessage.do?dsForumId=462&dsMessageId=1010183>.

 * #3209: Tests XFAIL due to changed tree-conflicts behaviour
     http://svn.haxx.se/dev/archive-2009-01/0538.shtml summarizes the tests
     that are failing because of real differences in pre-TC vs. post-TC
     functionality.

Optional:

 * Tree conflicts - non-essential issues:

   - #3329: Update/switch fails if the target itself is a tree conflict victim.
     Should print a 'Skipped' message instead.  Update of an item that is
     inside a tree conflict, and that no longer exists in the repo, does
     nothing.  Should print a 'Skipped' message instead.

  * Decide on svn_client_status_args_t, svn_client_status_args_create() and either 
     remove this argument struct, or move more arguments in the struct and maybe update
     hacking.html with the result.
     svn_client_status_args_t: r35512, r35515-r35514, r35518
     svn_client_log_args_t: r35242,r35245
