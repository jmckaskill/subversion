Status of 1.3.0:
================

Candidate changes:

  * r16350
    Fix issue #1911, where svndumpfilter generated invalid dumpfiles
    when copies occurred and --drop-empty-revs and --renumber-revs
    were in use.
    Justification:
      Invalid dumpfiles are not nice.
    Votes:
      +1: cmpilato, kfogel
      +0: dlr (concept, new to this area of the code)

  * r16708, r16710, r16712
    Add functions to duplicate the svn_info_t and svn_prop_t structures.
    Justification:
      Needed by the Ruby bindings to fix segfaults related to pool scoping.

Approved changes:

  * r16704
    Revert r16486. Perl bindings linkage change.
    Justification:
      Better to be slightly buggy on all platforms than not buggy on some
      platforms and seriously buggy on others.

      +1: maxb, dlr, djames
