This file tracks the status of releases in the 1.5.x line.

See "Stabilizing and maintaining releases" in trunk/www/hacking.html for
details on how release lines and voting work, what kinds of bugs can
delay a release, etc.

Note: Because we anticipate a reasonable amount of new development
will still be required for Subversion 1.5, we are for the time being
applying the "somewhat looser voting system for areas that are not
core code" to the entire branch.

Status of 1.5.0:
================

Candidate changes:

 * r29939, r29942, r29986
   Add validation of SSL server certificates to ra_serf.
   Notes:
     Requires serf 0.2 (unreleased), code doesn't get built with older
     versions.
   Votes:
     +1: lgo
  
 * r30030
   Always pass --tag=CC / --tag=CXX option to libtool.
   Justification: Checking if libtool supports these options gives false
     results with libtool-2.2.
   Notes: 
     This removes support for libtool <1.5 (but a quick survey showed
     that nobody was using it, anyway.)

 * r30086
   Fix an ancient mod_dav_svn bug that causes invalid URLs to be
   transmitted in the update REPORT response.
   Notes:
     This bug only shows up when using ra_neon against a server that 
     doesn't support send-all style REPORT responses.
   Votes:

 * r29922
   Add a new SVNAllowBulkUpdates mod_dav_svn directive which toggles
   support for send-all style update REPORT responses (versus the
   original, and now ra_serf-employed, skelta-style ones).  This is useful
   for security-sensitive shops that want to track the GETs of each
   individual versioned file but can't mandate that ra_serf (which is
   still labeled as experimental anyway) be used.
   Notes:
     This depends on the r30086 grouping, else it opens up the opportunity
     for ra_neon switch operations to fail.
