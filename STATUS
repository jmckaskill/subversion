This file tracks the status of releases in the 1.7.x line.

See http://subversion.apache.org/docs/community-guide/releasing.html#release-stabilization
for details on how release lines and voting work, what kinds of bugs can
delay a release, etc.

Status of 1.7.1:

Candidate changes:
==================

 * r1147540, r1147541
   Remove unused variables in build system.
   Justification:
     Backporting of future changes will be easier.
   Votes:
     +1: arfrever
     -0: stsp (we can backport these when we need to)
     -0: gstein

 * r1180154, r1181090, r1181110, r1181215
   Fix svn_rangelist_merge so it allocates new svn_merge_range_t elements
   only when absolutely necessary.
   Justification:
     This addresses a serious inefficiency in memory usage when
     svn_rangelist_merge (or any of its callers like
     svn_mergeinfo_catalog_merge and svn_mergeinfo_merge2) are called in
     a loop.  Prior to this change svn_rangelist_merge2 could potentially
     reallocate *every* range in both rangelists.  For example, the peak
     working set memory for the reintegrate merge described in
     http://svn.haxx.se/dev/archive-2011-09/0254.shtml was 1,324,664 KB
     with trunk@1179545.  With this group that drops to 26,880 KB.
   Branch:
     ^/subversion/branches/1.7.x-r1180154
   Notes:
     r1180154 is the primary fix with some new tests.  r1181090 and r1181215
     is a minor optimization along with more new tests.  r1181110 is just
     a doc string typo fix.  
   Votes:
     +1: pburba, rhuijben

 * r1185746, r1186059
   Fix up some erroneous "Could not frob some targets because..." warnings.
   Votes:
     +1: stsp

 * r1185738, r1185763, r1185768, r1185886, r1186240
   Add support for upgrading absent nodes to the wonderfull wc-ng world.
   Justification:
     This should have been part of 1.7.0. Without this patch it is impossible
     to upgrade working copies with server excluded/absent directories.
   Notes:
     r1185738, r1185763, r1185768: adds a test for this problem.
     r1185886: fixes this issue and cleans up whitespace in the test.
     Merge conflicts with issue r1177732 group.  Branch includes both sets.
   Branch:
     ^/subversion/branches/1.7.x-issue4035-r1185738
   Votes:
     +1: rhuijben, philip

 * r1186121, r1186231
   FSFS: Fix validation so it doesn't hork preexisting repositories that
   triggered a bug once in their history.
   Justification:
     Such repositories are unusable without this revision.
   Votes:
     +1: danielsh

 * r1177732, r1186092, r1186101, r1186107, r1186109
   Fix issue 4035.
   Justification:
     Lots of user reports of checksum!=NULL assertions.
   Branch:
     ^/subversion/branches/1.7.x-issue4035
   Notes:
     Merge conflicts with r1185738 group.
   Votes:
     +1: philip, rhuijben

Veto-blocked changes:
=====================

 * r1146131 and followups
   Add svn_fs_verify() and implement rep-cache verification in FSFS using it.
   Branch:
     1.7.x-fs-verify
   Justification:
     Would be nice to extend verify already in 1.7.x.
   Notes:
     This does not include progress reporting; that has been postponed to 1.8.
   Conflicts:
     On fs_fs.c.  Resolve with 'theirs-conflict'.
   Votes:
     +1: danielsh, rhuijben
     +0: gstein (progress would be nice) (without r1161164, r1161180)
     -0: cmpilato (For a function with this name, the implementation is far
         too anemic. I'd prefer this be a private function in 1.7.x, leaving
         room for a future public API that really does full verification.)
         (without r1161164, r1161180)
     -1: danielsh (invasive, new feature)
