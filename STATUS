This file tracks the status of releases in the 1.4.x line.

See "Stabilizing and maintaining releases" in trunk/www/hacking.html for
details on how release lines and voting work, what kinds of bugs can
delay a release, etc.

NOTE:  This branch uses svnmerge.py for merge tracking.  Please familiarize
yourself with that tool if you plan to actually merge changes here.

For example, to merge a number of revisions from trunk into branch,
you can use the svnmerge.py script that is in the branch.

$ contrib/client-side/svnmerge.py merge -r 21000-21006,21008,21876
$ svn diff
$ svn commit

Do no run the svnmerge.py N separate times for each revision to merge
over, since svnmerge.py will not merge into a WC with uncommitted
changes.

Status of 1.4.1:
================

Candidate changes:

  * r21384, r21047, r19698
    A merge which results in a conflicted file in your WC should
    produce a "conflicted" merge notification.  'svn merge --dry-run'
    needs to be smarter about accessing the working copy (see issue
    #2584).
    Branch: 1.4.x-r21047
    Votes:
      +1: dlr (not 19698)

  * r21531, r21848, r21934
    Allow HTTP auth protocols to be configurable by way of a
    "http-auth-types" parameter.
    Justification:
      Allow GSSAPI/SSPI auth to be enabled/disabled on Windows with
      Neon 0.26.1+, addressesing numerous bug reports from
      TortoiseSVN, Subversion, Subclipse, etc.

      -1: cmpilato (new features showing up in patch releases?  nuh-uh.)

  * r21738, r21924
    Prevent an API violation from corrupting FSFS repositories, as seen
    in issue #2467 and reports from users.
    Justification:
      Silently corrupting the repository is a Bad Thing.
    Notes:
      Branch needed to avoid the backport of a new error code.
    Concerns:
      This isn't exactly a trivial fix.  We are also assuming that this
      is the cause of the corruption we've seen.
    Branch: 1.4.x-r21738 (-r21762:HEAD)

      +1: malcolm

  * r21897
    Add validation of the HEAD argument passed to 'svnmerge.py init'.
    Justification:
      This common gotcha otherwise results in an ugly stack trace with
      no meaningful feedback to the user.
    Votes:
      +1: dlr

  * 21282
    Delete the notes/old folder so it's not shipped anymore in the release
    package. The content of the /trunk/notes/old folder was moved to 
    /developer-resources/obsolete-notes.
    Justification:
      Doc change, don't include obsolete docs in release packages.
