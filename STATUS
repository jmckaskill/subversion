Status of 1.0.6:
================

Candidate changes:

  * r8867, r8868, r8902
    Trivial performance fix for mod_authz_svn; cache the access file per
    connection instead of reloading it per request.
    Justification: Saves at least 2 loads of the access file per update, plus
    an additional number of times equal to the number of entries in the REPORT
    response.
    Notes: Similar code has been present in mod_dav_svn to cache an open
    filesystem per connection.

      -0: kfogel  (Reviewed the change; it's not *so* trivial, and I'm
                   not sure an optimization like this belongs in a
                   patch release.)

  * r9861
    fixes reentrancy problem for javahl binding. The pool for a call could be
    destroyed before the end of the call. This could crash the jvm
    Justification: javahl binding only fix to prevent a crash

  * r9883, r9905
    Fix for crash in javahl binding. If the first parameter of SVNClient.list
    is null, the jvm will crash. r9905 is the result of a scan of the binding
    code searching for this problem in all possible places.
    Justification: javahl binding only fix to prevent a crash

  * r8027
    Passing a Revision.DateSpec in javahl failed with 
    java.lang.NoSuchFieldError because java.util.Date.getTime() was 
    searched as a field when it is a method. 
    Justification: small change in javahl binding only

  * r9338, r9340
    Add various missing library dependencies to build.conf, for various
    binding-related stuff.
    Justification: Trivial change, correctness, needed to allow build of
    bindings on platforms with stricter linking requirements.

  * r10159, r10176
    Require neon-0.24.7.  Fixes some nasty zlib bugs.
    Justification:  fixes malformed XML errors from large
                    ra_dav checkouts/updates/etc.  
    Notes: This really should permit 0.24.7 and newer in
    the 0.24 line.  But it doesn't.  We should figure this
    out before releasing 1.1.0 but I'm not going to bother for
    1.0.6.

  * r10148
    Fixes crash when deleting a revprop.
    Justification:  it's a crash.  we shouldn't ever crash.
    Comments: Do we want r10154 as well, then?  I'm not sure it's
      absolutely necessary, but it tidied up some bits of r10148.
      Also, r10148 does a lot more than just fix the crash.  It might
      be better to use a patch that *just* fixes the crash, and leave
      all the other goodies for 1.1.

  * r10132, r10136, 10138, 10139
    Allow user to interrupt between auth prompts.
    Justification:  not a critical bugfix, but something users have 
                    repeatedly complained about.

      +0: sussman (not yet reviewed)
      +1: breser

  * r10144
    Fix a crash caused by a race when getting status.
    Justification: Don't ever crash.  Requested by the TSVN folks
                   because the crash kills the whole Windows desktop.

      +1: bliss, kfogel, breser

  * r10186
    Allow COPY method on repositories with space in their name. (#1837)
    Justification: Embarrassing bug;  a one-line fix to mod_auth_svn.
                   (We weren't unescaping a URI).

      +1: sussman, lundblad, breser

  * r10185, r10192
    Fix crash when deleting revprop over ra_svn.
    Justification: Don't ever crash.
    Notes: Makes earlier servers close the connection immediately, still
           better than a crashing client.

      +1: lundblad, kfogel, breser

  * r10190
    Allow properties with colons in their name to be read with propget
    over DAV.
    Justification: If you can set it you should be able to read it.
