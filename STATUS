This file tracks the status of releases in the 1.5.x line.

See "Stabilizing and maintaining releases" in trunk/www/hacking.html for
details on how release lines and voting work, what kinds of bugs can
delay a release, etc.

Note: Because we anticipate a reasonable amount of new development
will still be required for Subversion 1.5, we are for the the time
being applying the "somewhat looser voting system for areas that are
not core code" to the entire branch.

Status of 1.5.0:
================

Candidate changes:

 * r29139, r29161
   Introduce 'svnadmin upgrade' and backing APIs.
   Justification:
     We shouldn't make upgraders-to-1.5 dump/load unnecessarily.
   Notes:
     r29161 is the removal of non-overlapping, non-related changes.
   Votes:
     +1: cmpilato
     -1: glasser: The svnadmin-upgrade branch was great, r29139 accidentally
         included unrelated changes to fs_fs.c (hasn't reviewed r29161)
 
 * r29127, r29135, r29136, r29138, r29163, r29164
   Fix issue #3026: _svn and .svn are silently ignored as file arguments.
   Votes:
     +1: kfogel (r29127, r29163, r29164)
     -1: glasser (The docstring for the new public API has some problems
         (mentioned on dev@); I'll be happy to remove this vote once that's 
         fixed.  [r29163 and r29164 might address these concerns. -kfogel])

 * r29143
   Fix duplicate revision detection in 'blame -g'.
   Votes:
     +1: hwright

 * r29155
   Allow packagers to build some parts of svn against installed svn libs.
   Votes:

 * r29176, r29210

     r29176: Don't remove reflected revisions from requested merge range list.
     r29210: Follow-up to r29176 don't reparent ra_session unnecessarily.
   Votes:
     +1: kameshj

   When choosing which revision to display for a line in 'blame -g', prefer
