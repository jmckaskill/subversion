  * r8708
    Use warnings pragma on perl hook-scripts.
    Justification: Perl correctness issue.
    Votes:
       +1: sussman
       -1: breser (Doesn't error out properly on older versions and 
                   needs more discussion).

  * r8846
    Add an example wrapper to help svn+ssh users using setgid svnserve.

  * r8867, r8868, r8902
    Trivial performance fix for mod_authz_svn; cache the access file per
    connection instead of reloading it per request.
    Justification: Saves at least 2 loads of the access file per update, plus
    an additional number of times equal to the number of entries in the REPORT
    response.
    Notes: Similar code has been present in mod_dav_svn to cache an open
    filesystem per connection.

      -0: kfogel  (Reviewed the change; it's not *so* trivial, and I'm
                   not sure an optimization like this belongs in a
                   patch release.)

  * r8993, r9002
    Fix deprecation warning from SWIG 1.3.20_ when building the Python
    and Java SWIG bindings.
    Justification: Subsequent releases of SWIG will remove support for
    the old flag.
    Votes:
      +1: dlr, breser

  * r9003
    Include the path to the directory containing libsvn_swig_java in
    SWIG_JAVA_LINK to allow the SWIG Java bindings to actually build.
    Justification: It is not possible to build the SWIG Java bindings
    without this fix.

      +1: dlr
      +0: breser

  * r9089
    Fix broken build of python swig bindings on win32. 
    Justification: single line fix in bindings file which replaces the
    non standard type "long long" with the matching apr type 
    "apr_int64_t". The python bindings will not build without it.
    Votes:
      +0: breser (I haven't tested python bindings but it looks and builds ok)
          dlr

  * r9104
    svn log -v should use forward slash for changed paths on Windows.
    Justification: The paths are for URLS they should be copyable for use on
    repo URLS.
    Votes:
      +1: breser

  * r9077
    Fix issue #1786: mod_dav_svn accepts multiple authors, only records one.
    Justification: without this fix, the author will be set to whomever was
    authenticated on the MKACTIVITY request, which includes anonymous.
    This would lead to (no author) commits, while most of the commit may
    actually have an authenticated user associated with it.  Also, changes
    of author during a single commit is prevented.
