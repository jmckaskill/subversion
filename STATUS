Status of 1.4.0:
================

Candidate changes:
      
  * r19919
    Fix SVN_CONFIG_NICE to work with autoconf 2.60-dev CVS and prereleases,
    which clobber configure arguments in AC_INIT. 
    Justification:
      Developer convenience throughout the lifetime of 1.4.x.
      Note that affected versions are already packaged within Debian etch.
    Concerns:
      Adds a config.nice.old file that has no relevance to this fix.

  * r20562
    API: Use named, not anonymous, structs and enums in new-in-1.4 cases, for
    consistency with the majority of existing cases.
    Concerns:
      All this does is introduce extraneous symbols into the global namespace.

  * r20600
    In mailer.py, allow mappings to apply to the diff_add_url,
    diff_copy_url, diff_delete_url and diff_modify_url parameters.
    Justification:
      The mailer.conf.example file says:
        It is typically used for computing from/to addresses, but can
        actually be used to remap values for any option in this
        file.
      This makes this statement truer (I haven't checked all the
      values that mailer.py accepts).

  * r20605
    Fix link errors in Mac OS X static builds.
    Justification:
      Static builds currently fail unless --disable-keychain is used.
    Votes:
      +1: malcolm
      +0: dlr (concept)

Approved changes:

  * r20609, r20612
    Fix the possibility of data loss caused by multiple merges (the
    first of which adds a file to the WC) and a commit in quick
    succession.
    Justification:
      Data loss is inexcusable.
