This file tracks the status of releases in the 1.3.x line.

See "Stabilizing and maintaining releases" in trunk/www/hacking.html for
details on how release lines and voting work, what kinds of bugs can
delay a release, etc.

Status of 1.3.0:
================

Candidate changes (NOT under subversion/bindings/swig):

  * r16350
    Fix issue #1911, where svndumpfilter generated invalid dumpfiles
    when copies occurred and --drop-empty-revs and --renumber-revs
    were in use.
    Justification:
      Invalid dumpfiles are not nice.
    Votes:
      +1: cmpilato
      +0: dlr (concept, new to this area of the code)

  * r16388, r16408
    Fix numerous bugs in the svn_fs_*berkeley*() APIs.
    Fix issue 2361 (recover on a FSFS repository errors if BDB not linked).
    Fix creation of BDB files in FSFS repositories by 'svnadmin recover',
      'svnadmin list-dblogs' and 'svnadmin list-unused-dblogs'.
    Justification:
      Not vital, but the creation of Berkeley DB files in a FSFS repository
      is a long standing bug which doesn't really give a good impression.

  * r16398 (parts NOT lying under subversion/bindings/swig/), r16614, r16616
    Provide APIs needed to fix Issue #2172 (segfaults in the Python bindings
    caused by pool lifetime problems).
    Justification:
      Segfaults are bad. In 1.3.x, Python bindings users should not have to
      worry about memory pools.
    Notes:
      r16398 contains both bindings and core changes, which have different
      minimum voting requirements for backport. Thus, the change is separated
      into two completely detatched entries.
      r16614 adds back a removed interlibrary private API. I know that there
      is some advocacy that people who mix core libraries deserve all the
      crashes they might get, but the clearest documentation of compatibility
      rules we have at the moment is the implementation of
      svn_ver_check_list() and svn_ver_compatible(), any by those rules, this
      wrapper should exist. Therefore, let us put in into 1.3.0, in order to
      decouple the 1.3.0 soak period from the ongoing discussion about
      library compatibility. If this wrapper function turns out to be redundant
      with the final consensus, then it is not a problem, as its presence does
      no harm.
    Votes:
      +1: dlr (not r16614, r16616), lundblad (not r16614, r16616), maxb

  * r16414, r16512, r16513, r16562, r16595
    Ensure that SWIG dependencies are correctly added to build-outputs.mk.
    Justification:
      Improves robustness of build system, fixes compile errors
      when user runs `make install-swig-py' without having run
      `make swig-py'.
    Notes:
      r16562: Followup to detect files not to scan for includes by name, not by
      existance.  Justification: Avoid a different code path being followed
      depending on whether the build tree is clean or not.
    Votes:
      +1: djames, dlr (not r16562, r16595), maxb

  * r16428
    Activate some Windows-specific behaviour on Cygwin too:
     - SVN_ASP_DOT_NET_HACK
     - Windows-specific augmented file:// URLs
    Justification:
      Cygwin is likely to be exposed to native-Windows-created WCs.

Approved changes (areas other than under subversion/bindings/swig):

Approved changes (under subversion/bindings/swig):

  IMPORTANT NOTE: All of the changes made in the "subversion/bindings/swig"
  directory up until r16582 have been approved. However, there are still
  core changes which need to be approved in order for the Python changes to
  build and compile cleanly (namely, r16398 and r16414).
   
  When all of the required core changes have been merged, we should
  rebranch the subversion/bindings/swig directory, using the following
  commands:
    
    rs=http://svn.collab.net/repos/svn
    svn rm $rs/branches/1.3.x/subversion/bindings/swig
    svn cp -r 16582 $rs/trunk/subversion/bindings/swig \
           $rs/branches/1.3.x/subversion/bindings/swig
  
  * r16398 (ONLY parts lying under subversion/bindings/swig/), r16477
    Fix Issue #2172 (segfaults in the Python bindings caused by pool lifetime
    problems).
    Justification:
      Segfaults are bad. In 1.3.x, Python bindings users should not have to
      worry about memory pools.
    Notes:
      r16398 contains both bindings and core changes, which have different
      minimum voting requirements for backport. Thus, the change is separated
      into two completely detatched entries.
      r16477 contains exclusively bindings changes.
    Votes:
      +1: djames, dlr
      +1 (concept): maxb (Don't understand the swigutil_py.c changes in
                          sufficient detail yet for full +1)

  * r16448
    %ignore svn_fs_set_berkeley_errcall.
    Justification:
      It is now redundant and so need never be wrapped.
    Votes:
      +1: maxb, djames

  * r16453
    Unify SWIG bindings typemapping of 'const char *' => 'const char *'
    apr_hash_t input parameters.
    Justification:
      Makes several additional APIs usably wrapped for multiple SWIG languages.
    Votes:
      +1: maxb, djames

  * r16470
    Move proxy_apr.swg from proxy/ to include/, leaving proxy/ to be a
    directory solely for build-time generated files.
    Justification:
      Keep branch close to trunk on this layout issue, because future build
      generator change will probably make use of this.
    Notes:
      Depends on r16414 and r16513.
    Votes:
      +1: maxb, djames

  * r16480
      Remove compatibility code for old versions of SWIG (SWIG 1.3.24 is now
      required).
    Justification:
      Don't ship residual mess.
    Votes:
      +1: maxb, djames

  * r16482
    Use _core.svn_pool_create instead of svn_pool_create.  This clarifies that
    we are importing svn_pool_create from _core, rather than using our local
    (deprecated) compatibility wrapper.
    Justification:
      Enhance self-documenting nature of the code.
    Votes:
      +1: maxb, djames

  * r16486
    Fiddle with the Perl bindings link command to avoid linking to installed,
    rather then build-tree libsvn_* libraries.
    Votes:
      +1: maxb, dlr

  * r16500
    Make svn_swig_py_init_asp_dot_net_hack static.
    Justification:
      Greater visibility is not required, so keep the exported namespace clean.
    Votes:
      +1: maxb, dlr

  * r16518
    Fix spacing in subversion/bindings/swig/python/tests/repository.py.
    Justification:
      Trivial stylistic fix.
    Votes:
      +1: maxb, djames

  * r16582
    Python bindings fix. Even a typemap which does nothing is better than one
    which does invalid pointer assignment.
    Justification:
      Invalid pointer assignments lead to badness - warnings, undefined
      behaviour, etc.
