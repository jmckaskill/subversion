This file tracks the status of releases in the 1.6.x line.

See "Stabilizing and maintaining releases" in trunk/www/hacking.html for
details on how release lines and voting work, what kinds of bugs can
delay a release, etc.

Status of 1.6.0:
================

Candidate changes:

 * ^/branches/1.6.x-UNC-paths
   Resolves the regression on 1.6.X that disabled UNC path support on Windows.
   (All \\server\share format paths were canonicalized to /local/dir format).
   Justification:
     A lot of Windows users use UNC paths in corporate environment. While
     not fully supported until issue #2028 and #2556 are resolved, this is a
     serious regression against older versions.
   Notes:
     Most of the changes in this branch are tests on the behavior of path
     functions. The real changes are in path.c and reroute unc paths to
     svn_dirent_*() functions. 
     The tests are there to make sure we don't regress again on the 1.6.x
     branch and to allow future merges in this part of the code.

  * r36093, r36292, r36406
    Improve some messages.

  * r36209
    Update paths to svnmucc.

  * r36388
    Recommend Neon 0.28.4.

Candidate if a new tarball is constructed (otherwise for 1.6.1):

 * r36049-r36051, r36131
   Resolve the SVN_ERR_MALFUNCTION() reproducible on Windows with
     svn ci "C:/Program FIles" C:/Windows
   by handling parent directories correctly.
   (r36050 and r36050 are typo fixes; r36131 some extra cleanup)
   Justification:
     This malfunction makes update_tests.py 32 abort on Windows. Which in turn
     delays the Windows automated testrun until a user confirms.
     (This doesn't fix this testcase; it just handles this part of the problem)
   Votes:
     +1: rhuijben, pburba
     +1: gstein (for a new CODE tarball, not a doc tarball)

 * r36159
   Fix proxying of LOCK and UNLOCK requests via WebDAV proxies.
   Justification:
     With the fix, each slave server tries to field the lock/unlock, resulting
     in competing ideas of what is and isn't locked.
   Votes:
     +1: cmpilato, rhuijben, arfrever
     +1: gstein (for 1.6.1)

  * r36238
    Fix build of RHEL5 RPM packages.
    Justification:
      Won't build properly without these changes.  Not a release blocker for
      1.6.0 but would be nice if the train is still in the station.  Otherwise
      please feel free to move to 1.6.1.
    Votes:
       +1: dws, arfrever
       +0: gstein (for 1.6.0)
       +1: gstein (for 1.6.1)

  * r36252-36253 (on branch 1.6.x-r36252)
    Fix valgrind UMRs.
    Justification:
      UMRs are undefined behaviour
    Votes:
      +1: philip, rhuijben, stsp, arfrever
      +1: gstein (for a new CODE tarball, not a doc tarball)
      
  * r36302
    Fix a small problem in the loggy upgrade process. Some v10 working copies
    have .svn/format, and some don't. The *intent* is to remove the file if
    present, so make the code match.
    Justification:
     If change-svn-wc-format.py is used to downgrade a working copy
     from 1.6 to 1.5 format, the script does not add the format file,
     rendering 1.6 clients unable to update the working copy again:
     "svn: Can't remove file '.svn/format': No such file or directory"
     Since the presence of that file has been deprecated for ages,
     let's just apply this easy fix to 1.6 instead of tweaking the script.
    Votes:
      +1: rhuijben, stsp, arfrever
      -0: gstein (for 1.6.0 since it isn't "needed" except for when somebody
                  uses a script which I conceptually disagree with)
      +1: gstein (for 1.6.1)

  * r36213
    Trivial help output fix.
    Justification:
      Errors in documentation are bad, obvious fix.
    Notes:
      Already merged to 1.6.x by Arfrever in r36214, but reverted
      in 36322 because it was not formally voted on.
    Votes:
      +1: stsp, arfrever
      +1: gstein (for 1.6.1; it can wait)


Status of 1.6.1:
================

Candidate changes:

 * r36178
   External merge-tool improvements.
   Justification:
     Makes automated merging easier, and also fixes a bug where a file
     which should be marked conflicted was consired sucessfully merged
     because the tool's exit status was not properly evaluated.
   Notes:
     The bug is only triggered when using an external merge tool with the
     --accept=launch option. I don't think we need to hold 1.6.0 on this.
   Votes:
     -0: rhuijben (Looks like a feature enhancement for a patch release)
     +1: stsp (I'd say it's a fix for a feature we already support (merge
               under control of external non-interactive tool), albeit
               the feature is currently so buggy that you can't use it.)

 * r36256
   Fix potentially awful performance of --ignore-ancestry merges.
   Justification:
     A very simple change which avoids an unneeded walk of the entire merge
     target.  For large WCs the performance improvment can be dramatic.
     See http://svn.haxx.se/dev/archive-2009-03/0067.shtml.
