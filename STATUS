This file tracks the status of releases in the 1.5.x line.

See "Stabilizing and maintaining releases" in trunk/www/hacking.html for
details on how release lines and voting work, what kinds of bugs can
delay a release, etc.


Candidate changes for 1.5.6:
============================

 * r34875
   Fix depth_tests.py 23 issues that sometimes occurs on Windows when a BDB
   repository is not unlocked fast enough to delete it in the testcycle.
   (Reported multiple times by Mark Phippard, Jens Peters and me as failure
   when testing subversion 1.5.x before release)
   Justification:
     Tests that often fail for the wrong reason, might hide real issues
     with our releases.

 * r34919, r34924
   Make svn client to use the 'LFS' capability of 'neon' to allow commits 
   of new file(post-compression) beyond > 2GB in size.
   Note that Neon currently doesn't support > 2GB on Windows, so this only
   fixes this issue on Linux, *BSD and probably MacOS.
   Justification:
     A simple cast limits our maximum upload file size on systems where neon 
     supports larger uploads.

 * r35297, r35367
   Allow svn_mergeinfo_parse() to tolerate unordered rangelists as input
   while still guaranteeing the mergeinfo it creates has sorted rangelists
   as required by all our rangelist manipulating APIs.
   Justification:
     Versions of svnmerge-migrate-history.py and
     svnmerge-migrate-history-remotely.py prior to r35358 could create
     mergeinfo in the repos with rangelists sorted in reverse order.
     Prior to r35297 this broke any subcommand which encountered this
     mergeinfo because svn_mergeinfo_parse returned a parsing error.

     +1: pburba, rhuijben

 * r35466, r35712, r35713
   Allow svn_mergeinfo_parse() to tolerate overlapping rangelists as input
   while still guaranteeing the mergeinfo it creates has no overlapping
   rangelists as required by all our rangelist manipulating APIs.
   r35713 fixes a possible range shrinkage introduced in r35466. (r35712 is
   a testcase for this issue).
   Justification:
     svnmerge-migrate-history.py and svnmerge-migrate-history-remotely.py
     can create mergeinfo with overlapping rangelists, which breaks any
     subcommand which encounters this mergeinfo because svn_mergeinfo_parse
     returns a parsing error.
    Note: Will conflict if r35297 group is not applied first.  Assuming
    r35297 is already merged, accept theirs-conflict on
    subversion\tests\libsvn_subr\mergeinfo-test.c to avoid a minor conflict.

 * r35516
   Prevent svnmerge-migrate-history.py from committing non-canonical
   mergeinfo.
   Justification:
     Make dead certain svnmerge-migrate-history.py can't create mergeinfo
     with overlapping or unordered rangelists.  Subversion <= 1.5.5 will
     error out if it tries to parse this mergeinfo, see issue #3302.

     +1: pburba, rhuijben

 * r35981
   libsvn_ra_serf: Following RFC2617, verify authentication header tokens
   case insensitive.
   Justification:
     Enables using serf from behind Microsoft ISA proxy servers.
     See http://subversion.tigris.org/ds/viewMessage.do?dsForumId=462&dsMessageId=1191733

 * r36106
   Resolves issue #3374, "svn cp --parents path URL encoding issues"
   For
     svn cp --parent ^/fö ^/dö/fö
   The --parents code checked and might creat^/d%C3%B6, while the file was
   copied to ^/dö as expected.
   Justification:
     Without this patch --parents is broken for utf8 characters in repos
     to repos copy and move operations.
