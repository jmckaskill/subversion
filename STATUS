This file tracks the status of releases in the 1.2.x line.

See "Stabilizing and maintaining releases" in trunk/HACKING for
details on how release lines and voting work, what kinds of bugs can
delay a release, etc.

Status of 1.2.0:
================

Candidate changes:

  * r14024
    Allow automated tests for the javahl bindings to be run before the
    bindings have been installed.
    Justification:
      Encourages hacking on the bindings, and improves user confidence.
    Votes:
      +1: dlr, fitz (concept)

  * r14280
    Build ZLib from sources on Windows.
    Justification:
      Cures major PITA for Windows developers, improves debugging support.
    Concerns:
      Not exactly a showstopper for 1.2.0.
    Votes:
      +0.9: brane (+1 for 1.2.1), dlr (ditto for 1.2.1), fitz (concept)

  * r14046, r14070, r14301
    Improvements in the testing framework
    Justification:
      Low impact; r14046 and r14070 should've been on the 1.2.x branch
      from day one. r14301 speeds up testing on Windows, where three
      tests run in parallel take hardly any more time than a single test.
      Not a core code change.
    Votes:
      +1: brane, fitz (concept [no win32 setup])

  * r14612
    ra_dav bugfix:  make 'svn commit' work on locked files with propchanges.
    Justification:
      2 line change.  Stop trying to look up a property name in a hash mapping
      paths->lock_tokens.  It's redundant, and guaranteed to overwrite the 
      existing value with NULL.

Approved changes (further review is welcome, but not required):

  * r14583
    Docstring fixes for the notification API revision.
    Justification:
      Just comment tweaks, fixing our API docs.
    Votes:
      +1: lundblad, brane, kfogel, fitz
