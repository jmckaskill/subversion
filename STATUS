  * r14716
    Fix of the Windows Installer's Add/Repair/Remove capabilities.
    Branch: innosetup-hsuninsfix-5x-1.2.x
    Justification:
      This fixes problems people had when using Windows'
      add/remove item in the Control Panel.
    Votes:
      +0: dlr (concept, no testing environment), fitz (concept)

  * r14116, r14722, r14759
    Optimize 'svn log' performance.
    Justification:
      The new --limit option does not help speed as much without this.

      r14722 depends on r14116, which is just comment fixes.

      +1: lundblad

  * r14736, r14775
    Open access baton to required depth for lock/unlock targets.

    Votes:
      +1: lundblad, philip

  * r14755
    Don't initialize libsvn_ra in svnversion:
    Justification:
      svnversion doesn't use the RA layer, and it only depends on it
      indirectly.
    Votes:
      +1: lundblad

Approved changes (further review is welcome, but not required):

  * r14732 
    Fix svn-push, which was segfaulting all the time, due to violating API
    not-NULL requirements.
    Justification:
      Totally broken without it. Trivial fix to silly problem.
