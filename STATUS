This file tracks the status of releases in the 1.5.x line.

See "Stabilizing and maintaining releases" in trunk/www/hacking.html for
details on how release lines and voting work, what kinds of bugs can
delay a release, etc.

Note: Because we anticipate a reasonable amount of new development
will still be required for Subversion 1.5, we are for the time being
applying the "somewhat looser voting system for areas that are not
core code" to the entire branch.

Status of 1.5.0:
================

Candidate changes:

  * r29962
    Enforce the fact that 'svn merge' requires a merge source.
    Notes:
      Should be in 1.5, because 'svn merge' with no arguments won't
      error otherwise, yet such an invocation is not (currently)
      meaningful, and therefore should error.

  * r29439
    Simplify (and optimise) parsing of the DAV response header in
    ra_neon capabilities detection.

  * r29797
    Fix sample VC6 build script.
    Justification:
      User-requested nomination (Masaru Tsuchiyama). I assume that the
      script is otherwise broken.

  * r29858, r29859, r29876
    Fix some bugs related to merges from foreign repositories,
    including bogus attempts at recording mergeinfo, and the creation of
    corrupt wcprops.
    Notes:
      r29859 isn't required, but minimizes the diff against trunk.

  * r29895
    ra_serf: Handle error contained in report XML during update to avoid an
    abort.
    Votes:
      +1: lgo

  * r29914
    Fix an old mod_dav_svn update REPORT response bug (failure to note stale
    lock tokens).
    Notes:
      Testing this is ... interesting, because current code avoids this
      codepath or works around the problem.  Test ra_serf by forcing
      libsvn_ra_serf/update.c:check_lock() to do nothing; test ra_neon by 
      forcing libsvn_ra_neon/fetch.c:make_reporter()'s 'send_all' parameter
      to be FALSE.  ra_neon will hopefully soon grow the same workaround for
      this bug that ra_serf uses, so backport of this fix isn't super-
      high-priority.

  * r29920
    Fix the ra_neon skelta-style update REPORT response handler to workaround
    the mod_dav_svn bug fixed in r29914 (but still present in old servers).

  * r29801, r29925, r29930
    Support Libtool 2.2.
    Notes:
      r29801 probably isn't required, but minimizes the diff against trunk.

  * r29958
    Fix a bug in filtering of self-referential mergeinfo.
