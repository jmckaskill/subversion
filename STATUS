Status of 1.4.0:
================

Candidate changes:

 * r19919
   Fix SVN_CONFIG_NICE to work with autoconf 2.60-dev CVS and prereleases,
   which clobber configure arguments in AC_INIT. 
   Justification:
     Developer convenience throughout the lifetime of 1.4.x.
     Note that affected versions are already packaged within Debian etch.
   Concerns:
     Adds a config.nice.old file that has no relevance to this fix.

  * r20041
    Get rid of requirement for another RPM package (chrpath) to build the
    Linux RPM packages.
    Justification:
      Using Fedora Core as an example, I figured out a better
      way to simplify build package requirements with patch instead of
      package.

  * r20077
    Fix merge failure when target of an add has been deleted.
    Justification:

    Votes:
      +1: rooneg

  * r20125
    ra_serf: Be more tolerant when updating a WC file without a delta base.
    Justification:
      Certain operations (switch) will cause a WC to invalidate the version-url
      parameter and causes ra_serf to crash on a subsequent update to that file.

  * r20170
    Don't carry around our own Visual Studio project files for Apache/APR --
    they only worked for APR 0.9.x and the user can manually convert them.
    Justification:
      Low impact and needed for Apache 2.2 compatibility.
    Votes:
      +1: djh, rooneg

  * r20180, r20187
    Finish Apache 2.2/APR 1.x build/test support for Win32.
    Justification:
      Low impact and fixes some build and test issues with Win32 and
      Apache 2.2.

Approved changes:

  * r19924
    Deprecate svn_io_set_file_read_write_carefully and update the
    svn_io_set_file_read* functions to deal with perms and attributes
    correctly on unix and Win32.
    Justification:
      Needed for Win32 with APR > 0.9.x.

  * r20008
    Fix issue #2566: svnserve can cause broken WCs.
    Justification:
      Involves protocol change that's good to have in 1.4, allowing
      the client to behave correctly with authz and ra_svn.
