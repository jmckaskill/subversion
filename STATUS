This file tracks the status of releases in the 1.6.x line.

See "Stabilizing and maintaining releases" in trunk/www/hacking.html for
details on how release lines and voting work, what kinds of bugs can
delay a release, etc.

Status of 1.6.3:
================

Candidate changes:

 * r37478, r37543, r37544, r37545, r37547
   Support using `svnversion` on files and improve some messages printed by
   `svnversion`.
   Justification:
     Some messages printed by `svnversion` are inconsistent and sometimes
     incorrect:
     $ svnversion /usr
     exported
     $ svnversion /bin/ls
     '/bin/ls' not versioned, and not exported
     $ svnversion VERSIONED_FILE
     'VERSIONED_FILE' not versioned, and not exported
     $ svnversion /nonexistent
     subversion/libsvn_wc/questions.c:90: (apr_err=2)
     svn: '/nonexistent' does not exist
     ^^^
     Messages with these revisions backported:
     $ svnversion /usr
     Unversioned directory
     $ svnversion /bin/ls
     Unversioned file
     $ svnversion VERSIONED_FILE
     NUMBER
     $ svnversion /nonexistent
     '/nonexistent' doesn't exist

 * r37491, r37593, r37618
   Another merge performance improvement: Reduce contacts with server when
   a subtree with mergeinfo has non-inheritable mergeinfo and the subtree's
   immediate children have no explicit mergeinfo.
   Justification:
     If you hit this use case and the and the subtree in question has a *lot*
     of immediate children without mergeinfo then this change will avoid
     needless round trips for *each* of those children.
   Notes:
     There is a call to svn_uri_basename() in
     inherit_implicit_mereginfo_form_parent() that must be changed to
     svn_path_basename() since the former is new for 1.7.
     r37491 is the fix, r37593 is a typo fix, r37618 is some code refactoring
     to address gstein's bloat concern.

     -0: gstein (code bloat)

 * r37622
   Work around a buffer overflow bug in some APR versions (recently
   fixed) by (ultimately) using apr_brigade_write() instead of
   apr_brigade_vprintf() to transmit large chunks of base64-encoded
   property data.
   Branch:
     ^/branches/1.6.x-r37622
   Justification:
     Failure case comes as a surprise, and basically blocks svnsync from
     moving on past a troublesome revision.  Upgrading APR to a fixed
     version is good, but not necessarily an option.  Our workaround is
     easier to deploy.
   Notes:
     Because of some refactoring work done on trunk, this isn't so
     much a backport as a reimplementation.  But merging the branch
     should do the trick.
   Votes:
     +1: cmpilato

 * r37627
   Fix for issue #3126 'svn mergeinfo shows too few or too many eligible
   revisions'
   Branch:
     ^/branches/1.6.x-r37627
   Justification:
     Without this change the svn mergeinfo subcommand gives incorrect
     and inconsistent results when encountering non-inheritable mergeinfo.
     See http://subversion.tigris.org/issues/show_bug.cgi?id=3126#desc5.
   Notes:
     r37627 revved the svn_mergeinfo_remove and svn_mergeinfo_intersect
     APIS.  So I created a backport branch that moves the declaration for
     these to subversion/include/private/svn_mergeinfo_private.h.

 * r37827
   If the configure script check for bindtextdomain() in libintl fails,
   try again with -liconv.
   Justification:
     Fixes NLS support detection at least on OpenBSD, and maybe more systems.
   Notes:
     I patched this bug ages ago for the OpenBSD Subversion package
     but never committed a fix for it here (my bad).

 * r37835
   Fix issue #3382, "svn status does not show tree conflicts when svn:ignore=*"
   Justification:
     You're not going to argue about this, right?
   Notes:
     See the issue for more information. If you want to reproduce the
     bug, follow the steps outlined in this post:
     http://subversion.tigris.org/ds/viewMessage.do?dsMessageId=1357155&dsForumId=1065
     And note that svn --no-ignore works around the bug.

 * r37838
   Hopefully fix issue #3347, "svn never times out when (public) IP changes"
   Justification:
     The svn client should not assume that network problems are never
     going to happen, or will always eventually go away if they happen.
     There is no good reason for infinite timeouts when reading from sockets.
   Notes:
     I said "Hopefully fix" only because I have not gotten feedback from the
     submitter of issue #3347 yet if this patch really fixes his problem.
     But regardless of that that an infinite timeout when reading from a
     socket is a bad idea. See issue #3347 and the log message for more info.
