Status of 1.6.7:
================

Candidate changes:

 * r37478, r37543, r37544, r37545, r37547
   Support using `svnversion` on files and improve some messages printed by
   `svnversion`.
   Justification:
     Some messages printed by `svnversion` are inconsistent and sometimes
     incorrect:
     $ svnversion /usr
     exported
     $ svnversion /bin/ls
     '/bin/ls' not versioned, and not exported
     $ svnversion VERSIONED_FILE
     'VERSIONED_FILE' not versioned, and not exported
     $ svnversion /nonexistent
     subversion/libsvn_wc/questions.c:90: (apr_err=2)
     svn: '/nonexistent' does not exist
     ^^^
     Messages with these revisions backported:
     $ svnversion /usr
     Unversioned directory
     $ svnversion /bin/ls
     Unversioned file
     $ svnversion VERSIONED_FILE
     NUMBER
     $ svnversion /nonexistent
     '/nonexistent' doesn't exist

 * r38004, r38014, r38028, r38122
   Make KWallet window attached to terminal window.
   Justification:
     Without this change, KWallet window can appear behind terminal window
     and is left after killing terminal.

     -0: psamuelson, stsp (without r38122) (code is ugly and Linux-specific -
                                            would getenv("WINDOWID") work
                                            instead?)

 * r38142, r38267, r38269, r36788, r37129, r37521, r37591, r37523, r38195,
   r38247, r38325, r38349, r38352
   Fix issue #3432 'Merge can record mergeinfo from natural history gaps'
   Justification:
     Gaps in merge sources can lead to the creation of invalid mergeinfo
     or the removal of valid mergeinfo.
   Notes:     
     The fix itself in r38325 is relatively simple, but recent refactoring
     of the merge code on trunk makes it look a lot worse than it is.
     Unless otherwise noted, all of the following are nominated simply to
     avoid a conflict nightmare:
     r38142, r38267, r38269 - New test and test tweaks for the issue.
     r36788 - Comment changes only.
     r37129 - Scope reduction of a pool.
     r37521 - Minor bug fix and some refactoring.
     r37591 - Comment changes only.
     r37523 - Merge code refactoring.
     r38195 - Pool use cleanup, no functional change.
     r38247 - More merge code refactoring.
     r38349 - Variable rename to avoid shadowing a previous local.
     r38352 - Remove an unused variable.

 * r35958, r36030, r38373, r38836, r38837, r38842
   Several fixes to the Win32 exception handler. This change also makes it
   available on Windows Vista and 7 where it was previously blocked by a
   version check.
   Justification:
     This exception handler is a valuable debugging tool for users who don't
     have development tools installed. (Most users on Windows).
   Notes:
     Most of these revisions cancel out each other. The real changes are in
     r38373 (removing version check) and r38836,r38842 (fixing formatting
     specifier). It's probably easier to review the combined patch than the
     individual revisions.
   Branch:
     ^/branches/1.6.x-r38836.
   Votes:
     +1: rhuijben
     +0: pburba - I don't have a Vista or Win7 box to try this out on, but it
         works fine on my XP box.

 * r39019
   Fix bug where svn_[rangelist|mergeinfo]_[merge|intersect|remove|diff]
   APIs can modify their *non*-output arguments.
   Justification:
     No reports of this causing any problems that I know of, which is
     probably due to the fact that users of an API like svn_mergeinfo_merge
     typically only care about the output arguments.  The new C tests added
     to mergeinfo-test.c clearly demonstrate the bug.
   Branch:
     Resolves a minor conflict in libsvn_client/merge.c where the code
     changed was refactored on trunk.

   Votes:

     -0: julianfoad (reviewed the changes in mergeinfo.c only;
           and also it seems to sneak in another bug fix in
           fix_deleted_subtree_ranges(). I suggest splitting up this patch.)

 * r39614
   Support Berkeley DB 4.8.
   Votes:
     +1: arfrever

 * r39692
   Fix issue #3498: Subversion password stores freeze Eclipse
   Justification:
     All subclipse users are in great need of this.
   Branch:
     Resolves a minor conflict in libsvn_auth_gnome_keyring/gnome_keyring.c
     where the code changed was refactored on trunk.

 * r39828, r39842
   Disables file synchronization mutexes in fsfs on Windows. These mutexes
   were added to make POSIX systems lock files that were in use by other
   threads in the same process.
   
   Windows implements per filehandle locking, so it doesn't need these
   locks. We usually see the opposite problem in Subversion.
   Justification:
     This gives a measurable performance boost (5% decrease in running time
     on running the testsuite in parallel mode (on trunk). The difference
     will be bigger when measured on a real subversion server like one
     running apache or svnserve.

 * r40088
   Update the expectation of a ruby bindings test.  Follow on to the already
   merged r39219.
   Justification:
     Gets rid of a misleading test failure.
   Votes:

 * r40152
   Fix issue #3487, "cannot update many externals at once (over ra_svn)"
   Justification:
     Working copies with a huge number of externals cannot be used.
   Notes:
     See the issue for a reproduction script which fails without this fix.
