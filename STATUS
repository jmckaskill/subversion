This file tracks the status of releases in the 1.6.x line.

See "Stabilizing and maintaining releases" in trunk/www/hacking.html for
details on how release lines and voting work, what kinds of bugs can
delay a release, etc.

Status of 1.6.0:
================

Candidate changes:
 
 * r36009
   Bump recommended and shipped SQLite version.
   Justification:
     I normally wouldn't care to nominate this, but since we are still in RC
     stage, we should go ahead and use the latest version of SQLite, if
     possible.
   Note:
     We can still ship the newer version without this change, but it makes
     sense to be recommending it in configure.
   Votes:
     +1: hwright, rhuijben
     +0: gstein (ie. only if a new tarball is constructed)

 * r36027, r36035
   Store 64-bit values pulled from the rep cache database.
   Justification:
     Possibly data corruption on repositories with shard reps in large rev
     files.
   Notes:
     r36027 addes the proper API, and r36035 uses it.
   Votes:
     +1: hwright, rhuijben
     +0: gstein (ie. only if a new tarball is constructed)
     
 * ^/branches/1.6.x-dirent-basename
   Drop svn_dirent_basename, svn_dirent_split, svn_uri_basename, svn_uri_split
   from the public api to allow redefining its behavior for 1.7. 
   The branch updates the single caller of this new api to use the 1.5 api.   
   Justification:
     The current dirent_basename api design makes it very hard to resolve
     issues like #2556 ('cd e:\; svn update e:\' fails).
   Votes:
     +1: rhuijben, gstein
     
Candidate if a new tarball is constructed (otherwise for 1.6.1):

 * r35985, r36017
   Resolve serf NULL dereference from an invalid switch operation. r36017
   makes sure switch_tests.py 10 still fails after this crash. (35985 doesn't
   fix the issue tested for).
   Justification:
     Null dereferences in a library are bad. (And crashes that delay the
     testrun until a user accepts the failure just delay our releases).
   Votes:
     +1: rhuijben
     +1: gstein (for 1.6.1)

 * r35982
   Resolve possible uninitialized pointer references on receiving an invalid
   authentication header.
   Justification:
     Allows a server to crash the library.
   Votes:
     +1: rhuijben
     +1: gstein (for 1.6.1)
     
 * r36049
   Resolve the SVN_ERR_MALFUNCTION() reproducable on Windows with
     svn ci "C:/Program FIles" C:/Windows
   by handling parent directories correctly
   Justification:
     This malfunction makes update_tests.py 32 abort on Windows. Which in turn
     delays the Windows automated testrun until a user confirms.
     (This doesn't fix this testcase; it just handles this part of the problem)
   Votes:
     +1: rhuijben

 * r36106
   Resolves issue #3374, "svn cp --parents path URL encoding issues"
   For
     svn cp --parent ^/fö ^/dö/fö
   The --parents code checked and might create ^/d%C3%B6, while the file was
   copied to ^/dö as expected.
   Justification:
     Without this patch --parents is broken for utf8 characters in repos
     to repos copy and move operations.
   Votes:
     +1: rhuijben

 * r36111
   On Windows don't retry deleting a file 100 times when this file is really
   not a file but just a directory.
   Justification:
     Makes removing unversioned directories much faster.
     (You can see the delay with: svn rm --force <unversioned-empty-dir>)

     +1: rhuijben
