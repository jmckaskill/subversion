This file tracks the status of releases in the 1.1.x line.

See "Stabilizing and maintaining releases" in trunk/HACKING for
details on how release lines and voting work, what kinds of bugs can
delay a release, etc.

Status of 1.1.1:
================

Candidate changes:

  * r11284, r11321
    Fix memory usage bloat in ra-dav commits.
    Justification:
      Scalability.
    Notes:
      r11321 is just a docstring addition -- we can drop that from
      this merge if folks really care.

  * r11394
    Fix javahl bindings not using the default config directory if nothing
    else is specified.
    Justification:
      User complaint.  Simple fix in javahl binding only.

  * r11490, r11501, r11514, r11545, r11547 (Issue #2011)
    Fix UNC paths on Windows 
    Justification:
      It used to work.  It should work now.
    Notes:
      r11490 is just cleanups.  But makes it merge cleanly.
    Votes:
      +1: breser, lundblad
      +1: jszakmeister (without r11545 and r11547)

  * r11483 (Issue #2091)
    Unitialized variable on Win98.
    Justification:
      It was causing random failures for our Win98 users.  The fix
      also correctly sets the locale path now, making locale stuff
      work as well.
    Votes:
      +1: jszakmeister

  * r11527
    Fix blame calculation algorithm.
    Justification:
      Correctness issue.
    Votes:
      +1: mbk

Status of 1.1.2:
================

Candidate changes:

  * r11215, r11264
      SVN has needed a good packaging script for Win32 since forever.
    Justification:
      This and the related build and test script changes will make
      creating 1.1.x Win32 binary packages a lot easier.
    Note: This depends on other changes not mentioned above; I'll
      develop the patch on branches/1.1.x-build.
