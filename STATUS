This file tracks the status of changes proposed for inclusion in 1.0.
Each candidate consists of a short identifying block (e.g., a revision
number, maybe an issue number), a brief description of the change, an
at-most-one-line justification of why it should be in 1.0, perhaps
some notes/concerns, and finally the votes.  The notes and concerns
are meant to be brief summaries to help a reader get oriented; please
don't use the STATUS file for actual discussion, use the dev@ list or
irc instead.

Here's an example, probably as complex as an entry would ever get:

   * r98765 (issue #56789)
     Make commit editor take a closure object for future mindreading.
     Justification: API stability, as prep for future enhancement.
     Notes: There was consensus on the desirability of this feature in
       the near future; see thread at http://... (Message-Id:
       blahblahblah).
     Concerns: Vetoed by jerenkrantz due to privacy concerns with the
       implementation; see thread at http://... (Message-Id: blahblahblah)
     Votes:
       +1: ghudson, bliss
       +0: cmpilato
       -0: gstein
       -1: jerenkrantz

A change needs three +1 votes from full committers (or partial committers
with access to the involved paths), and no vetoes, to go into the release.

If you cast a veto (i.e. -1), please state the reason in the concerns
field, and include a url / message-id for the list discussion if any.
You can go back and add the link later if the thread isn't available
at the time you commit the veto.

Voting +1 on a change doesn't just mean you approve of it in principle.
It means you have thoroughly reviewed the change, and find it correct
and as nondisruptive as possible.  When it is committed to the release
branch, the log message will include the names of all who voted for
it, as well as the original author and the person making the commit.
All of these people are considered equally answerable for bugs.

If you've reviewed a patch, and like it but have some reservations,
you can write "+1 (concept)" and then ask questions on the list about
your concerns.  You can write "+0" if you like the general idea but
haven't reviewed the patch carefully.  Neither of these votes counts
toward the total, but they can be useful for tracking down people who
are following the change and might be willing to spend more time on
it.

the section for unapproved changes.)

   * r8016, r8019, r8028
     Copyright notice fixes.
     Justification: Why have copyright notices at all unless legally proper?
     Notes: This goes with r8127, but the others here haven't reviewed
            that change, so it needs to be listed separately for now.
     Votes:
      +1: rooneg, ghudson, dionisos

     Fixes to make 'svn blame' work with i18n and uri-escaped filenames.

     Notes: alternative is to simply remove this late-added feature
     Votes:
      +1: jerenkrantz, rooneg, jszakmeister, ghudson
      -0: gstein


   * r8048

     Votes:
      +1: jerenkrantz, rooneg, ghudson, dionisos, epg, cmpilato, striker
      -0: gstein (revert of many files is uncommon)


   * r8013
     Add may_save option to the auth prompt functions and credentials.
     Justification: trivial change, but important for GUI clients
     Notes: This should be applied together with r8101, which fixes a
            doc bug in this.  I (kfogel) have removed my veto on this,
            because r8101 has three votes now.
     Votes:
      +1: jerenkrantz, bliss, ghudson, epg, sussman, striker
      -0: gstein

     Justification: very low risk, and accurate documentation is good
     Votes:
      +1: jerenkrantz, rooneg, ghudson, dionisos, gstein, striker


   * Issue #1652
     Error messages cf most important conventions [patch in issue].
     Justification: low impact (though huge); better user experience
     Notes: Should apply this after most other changes, to avoid
            creating silly merge problems.

      +1: ghudson, epg, sussman
      +0: cmpilato


   * Issue #1639 (r8014)

   * r8129
     Improved blame cancellation support.
     Justification: better UI, fixes latent tempfile leak; low risk.

      +0: sussman
      -0: gstein (or remove the feature)


   * r8154
     Fix a small bug in the FS history harvesting code.  
     Notes:  The codespeak repository is sufficient complex enough
             (history-wise) to trigger this bug (seen by the inability
             to run 'svn blame' on certain files in the repository).
     Votes:
      +1: cmpilato, jerenkrantz, jszakmeister, striker
      +1 (concept): gstein

      +1 (concept): gstein


   * r8127
     Copyright notice fixes, like the {r8016, r8019, r8028} change.
     Justification: Same as for above-referenced change.
     Notes: The patch to trunk/subversion/bindings/com/SVNCOM.rc looks
            like it modifies the whole file, because it fixed the line
            endings in the repository.  See r8127 log msg for details.
     Votes:
      +1: kfogel, jszakmeister, ghudson
      +1 (concept): gstein (not reviewed)


   * r8035, r8036, r8037, r8128, r8156

      +1 (concept): gstein
      +1: kfogel, david, striker

These changes are to Subversion bindings.  Many are dependent on
specific "core" changes in the previous section, so we're planning to
finalize this list (and its votes) after we know the core changes,
that is, after Thursday, Jan. 8th 2004.

Bindings changes that affect the build system:

   * r8082
     Fix for bindings build on Windows. Related to issue 1666.
     Justification: Python bindings will not build otherwise. Low risk.
     Votes:
       +1: brane, jerenkrantz, gstein, striker
       +0: cmpilato


   * r8106
     Add --enable-swig-bindings option to select build targets
     included in standard make.
     Notes:  this is bindings change, but potentially higher risk,
             because it touches the core build system.

     Votes:
      +1: clkao, epg, jerenkrantz


Bindings changes that don't affect the build system:

   * r8057 (depends on core changes r8053, r8054)
     Constructor for svn_client_ctx_t used in javahl bindings.
     Justification: Implementation of above API change in javahl bindings.
     Notes: this obviously assumes svn_client_ctx_t gets imp'd (see above)
     Votes:
      +1: ghudson, rooneg
      +1 (concept): gstein


   * r8031  ('svn revert' performance fix, API change)
     Implementing API change of r8021 in javahl bindings.
     Justification: with 8021 and without 8031 javahl breaks. Local change.
     Votes:
      +1: ghudson
      +1 (concept): gstein (assuming base change imp'd)


   * r8012 (add retry-count to SSL auth providers)
     Implementing API change of r8006 in javahl bindings.
     Justification: with 8006 and without 8012 javahl breaks. Local change.
     Votes:
      +1: ghudson
      +1 (concept): gstein (assuming base change imp'd)


   * r8015,r8020  (add 'may_save' option to auth providers, for GUIs)
     Implementing API change of r8013 in javahl bindings.
     Justification: with 8013 and without 8015,8020 javahl breaks. Local change
     Votes:
      +1 (concept): gstein (assuming base change is imp'd)


   * r8022, r8024, r8038
     Improved interface for blame in javahl bindings.
     Justification: API stability; low risk because of bindings only change.
     Votes:
      +0: gstein


   * r8039
     javahl bindings did not know status external.
     Justification: API stability; low risk because of bindings only change.
     Votes:
      +0: gstein


   * r7998, r8000, r8018, r8075, r8117, r8118, r8158
     Perl bindings fixes and enhacements to date.
     Justification: Strictly perl only, not even affecting build system.
                    The bindings are not complete to be considered as
                    1.0, the maintainer wishes svn to include the
                    latest version in order to provide better supports.
