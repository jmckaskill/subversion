Status of 1.2.2:
================

Candidate changes:

  * r15253
    Fix Issue #2341: Perl bindings cat method fails when using a local file
    repository.
    Justification:
      Repeatedly using the client context to cat files via ra_local from the
      bindings eventually causes the interpreter to die without this fix.

    Fix memleak in character translation handle caching.

Approved changes (further review is welcome, but not required):

  * /branches/1.2.x-get-locks  (merge r15424:HEAD)
    Client bugfix:  make 'svn st -u' work against pre-1.2 mod_dav_svn.
    Justification:
      A serious backward-compatibility bug!  Very small codechange.
    Notes:
      The actual backported revisions are r15359, r15423... but the
      branch was required to fix a trivial conflict.

  * r15609
    Make SVN::Delta::Editor friendlier for debugging.
    Justification:
      Bindings only.  Makes error handling simpler.

      +1: clkao
      +0: djames  

  * /branches/1.2.x-authz  (merge r15467)
    mod_authz_svn bugfix: bad path-matching in recursive logic.
    Justification:
      It's possible to get authz failures when they shouldn't exist.
    Notes:
      See the original bug report at
