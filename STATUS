This file tracks the status of releases in the 1.3.x line.

See "Stabilizing and maintaining releases" in trunk/www/hacking.html for
details on how release lines and voting work, what kinds of bugs can
delay a release, etc.

Status of 1.3.0:
================

Candidate changes:

   * r16903
     Remove dependencies on APR in the SWIG code and build scripts,
     that prevent running autogen.sh --release through to completion.
     Branch: 1.3.x-r16903
     Justification:
       We can't release a tarball that doesn't depend on SWIG without
       this, because apr.h is system-dependent.
     Notes:
       Change backported in branches/1.3.x-r16903 to resolve conflicts
       with regard to the altered build system in trunk.

   * r16914, r16919
     Remove unused and unnecessary portability typemaps from the SWIG
     bindings. Followup to r16903.
     Justification:
       Unused and unnecessary portability typemaps can be misleading.

   * r16915
     Only allow SWIG 1.3.24 or 1.3.25.

   * r16930
     Tweak Perl bindings to avoid use of goto in svn_txdelta_apply.
     Justification:

       The goto &function syntax can cause segfaults, if the supplied
       function is a SWIG/C wrapper.
