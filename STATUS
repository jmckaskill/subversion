This file tracks the status of releases in the 1.4.x line.

See "Stabilizing and maintaining releases" in trunk/www/hacking.html for
details on how release lines and voting work, what kinds of bugs can
delay a release, etc.

NOTE:  This branch uses svnmerge.py for merge tracking.  Please familiarize
yourself with that tool if you plan to actually merge changes here.

For example, to merge a number of revisions from trunk into branch,
you can use the svnmerge.py script that is in the branch.

$ contrib/client-side/svnmerge.py merge -r 21000-21006,21008,21876
$ svn diff
$ svn commit

Do not run svnmerge.py N separate times for each revision to merge
over, since svnmerge.py will not merge into a WC with uncommitted
changes.

Status of 1.4.7:
================

Candidate changes:

  * r28578
    Fix incorrect raise of cleared error.  If this code path is reached
    (which happens if you symlink db/transactions/ to another filesystem, 
    say), the server will try to handle an error which is a dangling 
    pointer.  Madness (and even segfaults) ensues.
    Justification:
      Dangling pointers and crashes are bad.  Obvious fix.

  * r28544
    Fix an important memory leak in the Python bindings.
    Justification: Simple patch. This serious memory leak probably
    affects every non-trivial script which uses the Python bindings.

  * r21989, r22884, r23347-23349, r23357, r23359, r23363, r23364, r23384,
    r23385, r23387, r23395, r23763, r23764, r23794, r23795, r23799, r23807
    Bring mucc and mucc-test.py up to date with respect to trunk,
    except for r23427, which uses svn_stringbuf_from_file2() in 1.5.
    Justification:
      This is becoming a very useful tool for making restructuring
      commits that would otherwise require extremely large working
      copies.
    Notes:
      Blair ran mucc-test.py against this merge and it passed the
      test.  The person doing the merge should ensure that mucc-test.sh is
      deleted, as svnmerge.py skips that for some reason.  Also, if
      a test merge run is done with without committing and then
      reverting, then also delete the new mucc-test.py, since the
      next svnmerge.py will ignore it the second time around.

      -0: glasser (while backporting mucc is a reasonable idea, it has changed 
           a lot since this was proposed, including changing its name; either
           don't backport at all or backport even more)

  * r25178, -461
    Fix issue 2712: If 'anon-access' is 'read' but anonymous access is
    disallowed via authz rules, updates/checkouts won't work, even for users
    with appropriate permissions.
    Justification:
      User reported problem, small fix, includes test.

Veto-blocked changes:

  * r21531, r21848, r21934
    Allow HTTP auth protocols to be configurable by way of a
    "http-auth-types" parameter.
    Justification:
      Allow GSSAPI/SSPI auth to be enabled/disabled on Windows with
      Neon 0.26.1+, addressesing numerous bug reports from
      TortoiseSVN, Subversion, Subclipse, etc.
