This file tracks the status of releases in the 1.4.x line.

See "Stabilizing and maintaining releases" in trunk/www/hacking.html for
details on how release lines and voting work, what kinds of bugs can
delay a release, etc.

NOTE:  This branch uses svnmerge.py for merge tracking.  Please familiarize
yourself with that tool if you plan to actually merge changes here.

For example, to merge a number of revisions from trunk into branch,
you can use the svnmerge.py script that is in the branch.

$ contrib/client-side/svnmerge.py merge -r 21000-21006,21008,21876
$ svn diff
$ svn commit

Do not run svnmerge.py N separate times for each revision to merge
over, since svnmerge.py will not merge into a WC with uncommitted
changes.

Status of 1.4.4:
================

Candidate changes:

  * r21989, r22884, r23347-23349, r23357, r23359, r23363, r23364, r23384,
    r23385, r23387, r23395, r23763, r23764, r23794, r23795, r23799, r23807
    Bring mucc and mucc-test.py up to date with respect to trunk,
    except for r23427, which uses svn_stringbuf_from_file2() in 1.5.
    Justification:
      This is becoming a very useful tool for making restructuring
      commits that would otherwise require extremely large working
      copies.
    Notes:
      Blair ran mucc-test.py against this merge and it passed the
      test.  The person doing the merge should ensure that mucc-test.sh is
      deleted, as svnmerge.py skips that for some reason.  Also, if
      a test merge run is done with without committing and then
      reverting, then also delete the new mucc-test.py, since the
      next svnmerge.py will ignore it the second time around.

  * r24697, -9, 24793, 24827
    Fix issue 2743: fix property handling for locally replaced files
    Justification:
      Regression introduced in 1.4.0
    Votes:
      +1: lgo, malcolm
    Notes:
      There's a small merge conflict when merging the test case,
      backport branch not needed though.

  * r24926, r24939 
    Fix issue 2698: Merging replaced file does not update text-base version
    Justification:
      Small fix, non intrusive.
    Votes: 
      +1: lgo
      +0: giovannibajo (can't review on the patch, but interested in the fix)

  * r25076, -7
    Fix issue 1808: svn up deletes symlinks which are not under version control
    Justification:
      Data loss, small local fix
    Votes:
      +1: lgo

  * r25095, -099, -104, -105, -107
    Fix security flaw in 'svn prop*' commands [CVE-2007-2448]
    Branch: 1.4.x-r25095 (-r25119:HEAD)
    Justification:
      Security flaw (albeit not one we consider a serious one).
    Notes:
      This bug was fixed in the process of adding a new API, but we don't
      want to backport the new API stuff.  So review the backport branch
      changes, not the original commits.

Veto-blocked changes:

  * r21531, r21848, r21934
    Allow HTTP auth protocols to be configurable by way of a
    "http-auth-types" parameter.
    Justification:
      Allow GSSAPI/SSPI auth to be enabled/disabled on Windows with
      Neon 0.26.1+, addressesing numerous bug reports from
      TortoiseSVN, Subversion, Subclipse, etc.

      -1: cmpilato (new features showing up in patch releases?  nuh-uh.)

  * r21885, r22076
    Add a new RPM package for the AuroraLinux 2.0 SPARC distribution.
    Justification:
      It is a combination of RHEL3 and RHEL4 distributions with
      characteristics matching both, so we need a new directory.
    Branch: 1.4.x-r22076 (-r22079:HEAD)
    Votes:
      +1: dws
      -1: maxb (It appears that the auroralinux-2 directory has been based
                on an old version of the rhel-3 directory, pre-dating some
                of the difference-reduction work I did to try to minimize the
                unnecessary inconsistencies between the various distro
                flavours. Its introduction therefore represents a regression
                in the maintainability of the RPM packaging area as a whole.)

  * r19808-19810, r22853
    Synchronise license text and then bump copyright dates to 2007.
    Justification:
      It's 2007.
    Notes: We might want to wait until we actually merge something we
      originally committed in 2007, possibly hold until 1.4.4?
    Votes:
      +1: malcolm, dlr, hwright
      -1: jerenkrantz (This is an unnecessary change to backport.)

 * r24497, r24504
   Make Perl-based txdelta_window_handler actually usable by editors
   and related functions.
   Justification:
     Binding completeness.
   Votes:
     +1: clkao
     +0: glasser (I don't grok SWIG, but having this available in Perl is good)
     -1: djames (see http://svn.haxx.se/dev/archive-2007-05/0058.shtml)
