Candidate changes for 1.5.3:
============================

 * r32968, r32975
   Fix bug which occurs when a merge adds explicit mergeinfo to a subtree that
   had no explicit mergeinfo prior to the merge.  This new mergeinfo could
   obstruct any mergeinfo the path previously inherited and the new path
   was not getting mergeinfo set that described the merge itself -- See 
   http://subversion.tigris.org/servlets/ReadMsg?listName=dev&msgNo=142460.
   Notes:
     r32968 is a new test for this problem and r32975 is the fix.
   Justification:
     Incorrect mergeinfo results when this bug is encountered and it has
     already been encountered in our own repository as described in the
     aforementioned thread.

 * r30257, r33024, r33026
   Don't try to filter natural history from added mergeinfo during
   reverse merges.
   Notes:
     r30257 is the urelated removal of an unused private struct in merge.c,
     not required but avoids a conflict with r33024.  r33024 is a change to
     include more information in the merge command baton, it results in no
     functional change itself but r33026 relies on this new information.
     There's a single trailing whitespace conflict during merge of r33024.
     r33026 is the core change.
   Justification:
     A reverse merge should simply return mergeinfo to a previous
     representation -- see
     http://subversion.tigris.org/servlets/ReadMsg?listName=dev&msgNo=142777.
     This change also improves reverse merge performance as it eliminates
     some unnecessary communication with the repository.

Approved changes:
=================

 * r32977
   Fix the current early bailout of 'svn log' as exhibited during
   `svn log -gq -r31828 file:///usr/local/svn/subversion'.
   Justification:
     Server logic fault tolerance.  Code mo'-betta-ness.

 * r33178, r33185
   Avoid calling apr_stat with APR_FINFO_PROT | APR_FINFO_OWNER on 
   Windows, as this call is documented to be 'incredibly expensive, but 
   accurate' and the result is ignored anyway.
   Notes:
     r33185 contains some documentation that should have been in r33178.
   Justification:
     Doing costly calculations and then ignoring the result is not good.
     This patch resolves two of these cases. The first by removing the
     calculation and the second by disabling the code on Windows completely.
