Status of 1.6.17:

Candidate changes:
==================

 * r879766
   Fix issue #3498: Subversion password stores freeze Eclipse
   Justification:
     All subclipse users are in great need of this.
   Branch:
     Resolves a minor conflict in libsvn_auth_gnome_keyring/gnome_keyring.c
     where the code changed was refactored on trunk.
     ^/subversion/branches/1.6.x-r39692
   Votes:
     +1: stylesen
     +0: julianfoad (reviewed, not tested)
     -0: rhuijben (needs more explanation: The not-interactive and no
                   callback code paths should be more similar if the code
                   works correctly. I think the not interactive code path
                   needs the same fix).

 * r1028084, r1028125, r1041638
   Fix JVM recognition on OS X Snow Leopard (10.6).
   Justification:
     Buildings Subversion on OS X 10.6 can be impossible, or more difficult,
     without porting this.
   Notes:
     Apple has updated their JDK structure that results in its JDK not being
     found on Snow Leopard.  This can be worked around by using the --with-jdk
     configure option but it was never required before and the JDK structure
     isn't exactly intuitive enough to expect regular people to know how to
     find the right path to use.
   Votes:
     +1: jwhitlock, gstein
     +0.9: blair, I tested this on Snow Leopard and it worked, but
           didn't do a line-by-line review of the changes
     +0: danielsh (only touches java.m4)

 * ^/branches/1.6.x-r1053984
   Fix bug where committing a changelist was prevented by a file outside that
   changelist having unexpectedly changed special status.
   Justification:
     Local fix.  users@ reports.
   Votes:
     +1: gstein
     +0: danielsh

 * r962377, r962378, r1036978, r1037762, r1063572, r1063573, r1063592
   Fix issue #3641 svnsync handling of directory copyfrom.
   Justification:
     Could lead to sync'd repositories being different from the master.
   Concerns:
     http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.version-control.subversion.devel/120590
   Branch:
     ^/subversion/branches/1.6.x-issue3641
     All the revisions merge cleanly, the branch is only needed for a slight
     tweak to the expected dump file for svnsync test 29, to account for the
     differences in how 1.6 prints property hashes and how 1.7 does it, see
     r966458.
   Notes:
     See also the r1036429 group.
   Votes:
     +1: philip (r962377, r962378, r1063572, r1063573, r1063592 only)
     +1: pburba, cmpilato
     -0: danielsh (authz concerns on the original fix)

 * r1074572
   Allow building on Windows with a recent Expat.
   Justification:
     We like building Subversion, even on Windows.  User requested.
   Votes:
     +1: gstein
     +0: hwright (I like the idea, but have no knowledge of the change, or
                  ability to test it.)

 * r1076730, r1078954, r1081255
   Fix issue #3650 "log -g produces excessive duplicate output"
   Justification:
     Eliminates potentially massive duplication when tracing logs
     across merge reintegrations.
   Branch:
     ^/subversion/branches/1.6.x-issue3650
   Votes:
     +1: pburba

 * r1100213
   In FSFS, identify a corruption condition, and don't mask other (unknown)
   corruption conditions.
   Note:
     I think at least the latter part (the fs_fs.c part) should be backported.
   Votes:
     +1: danielsh, gstein

 * r939000, r939002, r1102803
   Provide clueful error when editor drive refers revision > HEAD.
   This situation would normally occur in master-slave setup.
   Justification:
     This backport fixes the following vague error:
       svn: REPORT of '/svn/repo1/!svn/vcc/default': Could not read
       chunk size: connection was closed by server (http://127.0.0.1)
     to:
       svn: A reported revision is higher than the current repository
       HEAD revision.  Perhaps the repository is out of date with
       respect to the master repository?
     if WebDAV proxying is enabled for the server.

Veto-blocked changes:
=====================

 * r877552, r877617, r877618, r877619, r877621
   Support using `svnversion` on files and improve some messages printed by
   `svnversion`.
   Justification:
     Some messages printed by `svnversion` are inconsistent and sometimes
     incorrect:
     $ svnversion /usr
     exported
     $ svnversion /bin/ls
     '/bin/ls' not versioned, and not exported
     $ svnversion VERSIONED_FILE
     'VERSIONED_FILE' not versioned, and not exported
     $ svnversion /nonexistent
     subversion/libsvn_wc/questions.c:90: (apr_err=2)
     svn: '/nonexistent' does not exist
     ^^^
     Messages with these revisions backported:
     $ svnversion /usr
     Unversioned directory
     $ svnversion /bin/ls
     Unversioned file
     $ svnversion VERSIONED_FILE
     NUMBER
     $ svnversion /nonexistent
     '/nonexistent' doesn't exist
   Votes:
     +1: arfrever
     -0: cmpilato (Introduces new features and changes output)
     -1: rhuijben (Introduces new features and changes output;
                   I think it should be removed from STATUS)

 * r878078, r878088, r878102, r878196
   Make KWallet window attached to terminal window.
   Justification:
     Without this change, KWallet window can appear behind terminal window
     and is left after killing terminal.
   Votes:
     +1: arfrever
     -0: peters
     -1: rhuijben ("/proc/%ld/stat" is ugly and Linux-specific -
                   would just getenv("WINDOWID") work instead?)
     -1: stsp (I've removed the Linux-specific code from trunk in r1002144
               and r1002151, so trunk code only relies on getenv("WINDOWID").
               I would +1 a backport that also merges these revisions).

 * r916286, r917512
   Fixes failing commmits (with vague error messages) seen on client
   side for WebDAV proxy configurations such as the following (note
   the trailing slash at the end of '/svn/'):

      <Location /svn/>
         DAV svn
         SVNParentPath /repositories
         # Trailing slash on the master URI also can cause the confusion.
         SVNMasterURI http://master/svn/
         SVNAdvertiseV2Protocol Off
      </Location>

   Error message shows up like so:

      svn: Commit failed (details follow):
      svn: MKACTIVITY of '/svn/demujin/!svn/act/4b6d547c-018d-4e02-9d3f-2b28\
      3076cc06': Could not read status line: connection was closed by server\
       (http://localhost)

   Notes:
     Depends on the r878590 group for a conflict-free backport.
   Justification:
     Fixes failed commits.
   Votes:
     +1: kameshj
     -1: pburba (the net change of r916286 and r917512 relies on the 1.7 API
         svn_uri_canonicalize.  This API does exist in 1.6, but only for
         testing purposes, see subversion\libsvn_subr\private_uri.h and
         http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=revision&revision=876419
         All that is *probably* needed is a backport branch which makes
         use of svn_path_canonicalize instead, but this will have to wait
         until the r878590 group is backported.)

 * r921453, r927184, r927243
   Fix reopened issue #3020 'Reflect dropped/renumbered revisions in
   svn:mergeinfo data during svnadmin load'
   Justification:
     Prior to this fix, when loading a partial dump with mergeinfo, the
     resulting mergeinfo in the target repository could refer to non-existent
     revisions or revisions that have nothing to do with the merge source
     in the original repository.  The original fix for issue assumed that
     the dump stream was for a complete repository.
   Notes:
     r921453 and 927184 are tests, r927243 is the fix.
   Branch:
     ^/subversion/branches/1.6.x-issue3020
   Votes:
     +1: kameshj
     -1: pburba (There is a regression with this fix, see
         http://svn.haxx.se/dev/archive-2010-03/0716.shtml)

 * r933194
   Fix for issue #2753
   SVNListParentPath feature doesn't work when svn authz is used.
   Justification:
     This issue is waiting for resolution for more than 3 years.
   Notes:
     See discussion at http://svn.haxx.se/dev/archive-2010-04/0275.shtml
   Votes:
     -1: cmpilato (pending results of aforemented discussion)

 * r950445, 950468
   Fix for issue #2591 "'svnadmin hotcopy' does not replicate symlinks".
   Justification:
     This fix helps server administrators who has common files symlinked
     across their repositories and take frequent backups of their repos
     using svnadmin hotcopy.
   Notes:
     r950445 fixes the issue and r950468 is a test for this issue.
     In r967173 on trunk, svn_io_dir_walk()'s original functionality
     was restored, and svn_io_dir_walk2() introduced to also cover
     symlinks.
   Votes:
     +1: stylesen,
     -0: julianfoad (Tested and works fine, but changes semantics of
           svn_io_dir_walk() which we should not do in a back-port.
           Discussing on list.)
     -1: cmpilato (Changes semantics of svn_io_dir_walk()).

 * r996383
   Add shorthands for 'svn --accept=%s' values.
   Justication:
     Require less typing to resolve conflicts.
   Votes:
     +1: danielsh, blair
     -0: rhuijben (Should we apply a change like this in a patch release?)
     -0: stsp (I'd say no...)
     -0: pburba (I see no harm, but have to agree with stsp)
     -1: cmpilato (to the degree that our command-line syntax is an API,
         this would prevent rollback to prior 1.6.x versions without
         changes to scripts which call this API)

 * r1036429
   Fix svnsync_tests 29 for BDB.
   Justification:
     Avoids an assert in the server.
   Notes:
     See also the r962377 group.
   Votes:
     +1: philip
     +0: stsp (it fixes the test, but pburba asked on IRC how this change
               will affect replaced directories and I'm not sure about that)
     +1: pburba (since we reverted r962377-962378 in r1037005 - see
                 http://svn.haxx.se/dev/archive-2010-11/0412.shtml, this
                 change is now dependent on the new set of issue #3641 fixes
                 that are currently nominated...so my +1 is conditional on
                 that fix being applied first.)
     +1: danielsh (pburba: a fix to #3641 was committed to trunk)
     -1: hwright (I'm not sure we need this: the merge conflicts, and the
                  assert isn't even in 1.6.x.  I'm happy to remove this veto
                  if a proper backport branch is provided.)

Approved changes:
=================

 * r878590, r878607, r878625, r878626, r878627
   In trunk we optimized the common case of 'find-and-replace with same uri'
   of proxied content thanks to issue 3445 "WebDAV proxy code munging user
   data".
   r878590 is just a change that adds FIXME marker to code comment. We take it
   to avoid spurious conflicts with other revisions.
   r878607 Special cases no-op find and replace.
   "r878625, r878626, r878627" are follow-up to r878607 and the other long 
   pending Master info leak to the clients.
   Justification:
     1. This group has the most common 'optimization' fix of *not* groking the
        proxied response to find and replace with same string.
     2. Fixes the master information leak via the Location header.
     3. Need this to be ported for the other defect to be ported
        without conflict.
   Votes:
     +1: kameshj, cmpilato, pburba
     -0: julianfoad (seem to be multiple changes here for different reasons -
           at least issue '3445 and an optimization and an information leak;
           r878607 log msg says it fixes bugs but it's not clear what bugs;
           don't know how to tell whether justification 1 is significant;
           justifications don't seem to refer to issue #3445. Please can we
           separate these changes and clearly describe each one? And update
           the r878607 log msg.)
