This file tracks the status of releases in the 1.6.x line.

See "Stabilizing and maintaining releases" in trunk/www/hacking.html for
details on how release lines and voting work, what kinds of bugs can
delay a release, etc.

Status of 1.6.19:

Candidate changes:
==================

 * r1144717
   Include SVN_ERR_FS_NOT_FOUND in SVN_ERR_IS_LOCK_ERROR().
   Justification:
     Consistent behaviour of the 1.7 client with 1.6/1.7 servers. (issue #3949)
   Votes:
     +1: danielsh, rhuijben
     -0: julianfoad (Too many loose ends.  Should SVN_ERR_IS_UNLOCK_ERROR()
         get the same treatment?  danielsh on IRC: "I'm not sure I was
         happy with the error/warning issue here.  but patching the server
         makes the reporting be ehwat the test likes (and what 1.7 does)."
         Does the error/warning thing matter?  philipm on IRC: "Does it fix
         multiple targets?"  Have we analyzed whether the test properly
         reflects real life needs?  Could the bug in unlock prevent people from
         removing a lock on a nonexistent path?)

 * r894014, 894029, 896247, 905705
   Use serf_connection_create2 instead of serf_connection_create so that
   1.6.x will be prepared to work with serf's upcoming ssl tunnel support
   (https over http proxy).
   Justification:
     Make use of new feature provided by the serf library, stop using
     an API that will be deprecated (although isn't yet).
   Note: this change doesn't require a change of the minimum serf requirements
     for this branch. r894014 is the main revision, the others are follow-up
     fixes.
   Votes:
     +1: lgo
     +0: gstein (haven't reviewed these specific revisions yet)
     -0: stsp (not a critical fix, serf is an optional dependency in 1.6.x)

 * ^/subversion/branches/1.6.x-testsuite-apr-hash-order
   Various test suite fixes, mostly backported from trunk, to allow
   most of the test suite to PASS with APR 1.4.6.
   Notes:
     All backported changes were also backported to 1.7.x.
     Some 1.6.x-specific changes were made, see r1383371 and r1383408.

     The known remaining failures are:

     log_tests.py 30: log -g should ignore cyclic merges
     Can fail because 1.6.x is missing r1293229, which fixed occasionally
     missing merged-via notifications.
   
     diff_tests.py 32: repos-wc diff showing added entries with props
     Can fail because this test is missing various tweaks to account
     for random output order of 'svn diff' (this is independent of the
     APR 1.4.6 hash order problem).
   
     ruby swig test 'test_dump'
     Can fail because 1.6.x is missing r966458, which sorted property
     listings in dump files in alphabetical order, and this test does
     not parse dump files and sort properties for comparison.
   Votes:
     +1: stsp

Veto-blocked changes:
=====================

 * r1138975, r1138977
   Add a sanity check to get-deps.sh.
   Justification:
     Prevent a false impression as to which version of a dependency will be
     used.
   Notes:
     r1138975 is the change.  r1138977 reverts accidentally-committed local
     changes.  Note that r1138977 replaces the bogusly-committed files rather
     than merges into them.
   Votes:
     +1: danielsh
     -1: stsp (not a security or data-corruption fix)
