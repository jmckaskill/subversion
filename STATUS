This file tracks the status of releases in the 1.4.x line.

See "Stabilizing and maintaining releases" in trunk/www/hacking.html for
details on how release lines and voting work, what kinds of bugs can
delay a release, etc.

Status of 1.4.0:
================

Candidate changes:

  * r20781
    autogen.sh: Purge *.pyc files from the build/ hierarchy after using the
    build generator, so that we do not ship them in tarballs.
    Justification:
      Shipping detritus like .pyc files in release tarballs is sloppy.

  * r20190, r20250, r20444, r20826
    A few improvements to the Windows build system including a fix for the
    swig perl bindings.  They are grouped together to avoid conflicts.
    Justification:
      Most are very low impact build improvements, but without r20826 the
      Perl bindings won't build on Windows.

      +0: dlr

  * r20172, r20828
    Update the Windows build instructions.
    Justification:
      Documentation that more closely matches the reality is good.

Status of 1.4.1:
================

Candidate changes:

  * r20384
    Fix issue #2583: 'svn diff' shouldn't require write access
    to the working copy.
    Justification:
      Relatively low impact change; most of it is copy-pasted from
      old (proven) code.
    Notes:
      translated_file_for_diff() never seems to be called (on trunk)
      with any flag other than SVN_WC_TRANSLATE_TO_NF.  Why does its
      implementation handle so many other permutations of FLAGS?
