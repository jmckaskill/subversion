This file tracks the status of releases in the 1.6.x line.

See "Stabilizing and maintaining releases" in trunk/www/hacking.html for
details on how release lines and voting work, what kinds of bugs can
delay a release, etc.

Status of 1.6.0:
================

Candidate changes:
 
 * r36009
   Bump recommended and shipped SQLite version.
   Justification:
     I normally wouldn't care to nominate this, but since we are still in RC
     stage, we should go ahead and use the latest version of SQLite, if
     possible.
   Note:
     We can still ship the newer version without this change, but it makes
     sense to be recommending it in configure.

 * r35985, r36017
   Resolve serf NULL dereference from an invalid switch operation. r36017
   makes sure switch_tests.py 10 still fails after this crash. (35985 doesn't
   fix the issue tested for).
   Justification:
     Null dereferences in a library are bad. (And crashes that delay the
     testrun until a user accepts the failure just delay our releases).
   Votes:
     +1: rhuijben

 * r35982
   Resolve possible uninitialized pointer references on receiving an invalid
   authentication header.
   Justification:
     Allows a server to crash the library.
   Votes:
     +1: rhuijben

 * r36027, r36035
   Store 64-bit values pulled from the rep cache database.
   Justification:
     Possibly data corruption on repositories with shard reps in large rev
     files.
   Notes:
     r36027 addes the proper API, and r36035 uses it.

 * <needs-branch> (1.6.0 only)
   I would like to redefine svn_dirent_basename to behave like 
   svn_dirent_entryname. (Return "" on roots instead of returning the root 
   itself as it does now.)
   If this doesn't go in 1.6.0 we have to deprecate svn_dirent_split and
   svn_dirent_basename for 1.7.0.
   Justification:
     The current dirent_basename api design makes it very hard to resolve
     issues like #2556 ('cd e:\; svn update e:\' fails).
     (There is currently only a single caller of these 2 functions in our 
      1.6.0 codebase, but it might break third party users if we fix this
      in a patch release.)
