This file tracks the status of releases in the 1.1.x line.

See "Stabilizing and maintaining releases" in trunk/HACKING for
details on how release lines and voting work, what kinds of bugs can
delay a release, etc.

Status of 1.1.1:
================

Candidate changes:

  * r10788, r10796, r10904, r10914
    Fix performance regression in character encoding translations.  Most
    noticable on Win32, but impacts other platforms as well.
    Justification:
      Slow "svn status" annoys people, especially TSVN users.
    Notes:
      Proposed during 1.1.0 preparation, but it is too late and complicated
       to put in 1.1.0 at this stage.
      This conflicts with the branch.  See the 1.1.x-r10788 branch.
      Causes httpd to crash on exit in some cases without r11458.

  * r11458
    Fix mod_dav_svn error leaks.
    Justification:
      Without this fix and with r10788 and friends, httpd can crash on
      exit.

  * r11394
    Fix javahl bindings not using the default config directory if nothing
    else is specified.
    Justification:
      User complaint.  Simple fix in javahl binding only.

  * r11490, r11501, r11514 (Issue #2011)
    Fix UNC paths on Windows 
    Justification:
      It used to work.  It should work now.
    Notes:
      r11490 is just cleanups.  But makes it merge cleanly.
      OTOH, r11490 breaks file://localhost//machine/repos unnecessarily.

  * r11483 (Issue #2091)
    Unitialized variable on Win98.
    Justification:
      It was causing random failures for our Win98 users.  The fix
      also correctly sets the locale path now, making locale stuff
      work as well.

Status of 1.1.2:
================

Candidate changes:

  * r11215, r11264
      SVN has needed a good packaging script for Win32 since forever.
    Justification:
      This and the related build and test script changes will make
      creating 1.1.x Win32 binary packages a lot easier.
    Note: This depends on other changes not mentioned above; I'll
      develop the patch on branches/1.1.x-build.
