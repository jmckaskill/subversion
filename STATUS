================

Candidate changes:

  * r16350
    Fix issue #1911, where svndumpfilter generated invalid dumpfiles

    were in use.
    Justification:
      Invalid dumpfiles are not nice.

Approved changes:
 
   * r16816
     Use new APIs for a sample script, svnshell.rb, to fix its breakage
     caused by using obsolete APIs.
     Justification:
       Although it is only a sample script, its breakage looks bad.

  * r16793, r16798
    Correct and clarify doc strings related to the new WC/repository
    state APIs in svn_wc.h.
    Justification:
      The doc strings otherwise indicate the opposite of the actual
      behavior, and in one case, the wrong initialization value.
