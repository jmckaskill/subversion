Status of 1.3.0:
================

Candidate changes:

  * r17394
    Change ra_local "invalid host" test to SKIP under Cygwin,
    as Cygwin has UNC paths too.
    Justification:
      Test erroneously fails otherwise. Failing test == bad.

      +1: maxb, dberlin

  * r17395
    Use the APR_BINARY flag on all calls to apr_file_open().
    Justification:
      Subversion never wants the OS or CRT to do EOL munging behind its back.
      I've been applying this to the official Cygwin binaries for some time.

  * r17396
    Create a workaround for the Perl bindings' usage of circular linkage.
    Justification:
      Needed for Cygwin, on which circular linkage is not possible.
