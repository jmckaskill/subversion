Status of 1.1.5:
================

Candidate changes:

  * r12694
    Fix use of incompatible pointer types in svndumpfilter.
    Justification:
      Avoid warnings.
    Votes:
      +1: maxb, dlr

  * r13983
    Correct valid warnings and bogus compilation errors specific to
    Jikes.
    Justification:
      Avoid warnings (and hard errors!), improve compile times.
    Votes:
      +1: dlr

  * r14041.
    Fix issue #2268 (svn update of xml-unsafe dir (from within) http error)
    Justification:
      Yet Another Path Escaping Bug
    Votes:
      +1: cmpilato

  * r14063, r14066, r14068, r14079, r14121 (with some changes)
    Branch: 1.1.x-r14063
    Justification:
      Issue #2265 can cause data loss.
    Notes:
      The new svn_fs_initialize API isn't included in this
      backport; we always initialize the mutex on a best-effort basis,
      which should be just fine for practical purposes.

  * r14333
    Fix remotely (meaning ra_dav/ra_svn) triggable crash in fsfs.
    Justification:
      Trivial denial of service attack.
    Votes:
     +1: ringstrom, dionisos

  * r14536
    Make backend tests explicit and do them for both BDB and FSFS.
    Justification:
      Complete testing = good.
    Votes:
      +1: david

  * r14716
    Fix of the Windows Installer's Add/Repair/Remove capabillities.
    Branch: innosetup-hsuninsfix-4x-1.1.x
    Justification:
      This fixes problems people had when using Windows'
      add/remove item in the Control Panel.
    Votes:
   +1:
   +0: dlr (concept, no testing environment)

  * r15253
    Fix Issue #2341: Perl bindings cat method fails when using a local file
    repository.
    Justification:
      Repeatedly using the client context to cat files via ra_local from the
      bindings eventually causes the interpreter to die without this fix.
    Votes:
      +1: jszakmeister

  * r15450
    Allow SVN::Pool type to be used as a pool parameter in the Perl
    bindings.
    Justification:
      The default allocator for client returns a SVN::Pool type,
      but clients can't actually pass it to individual client
      commands without this patch.
    Votes:
      +1: jszakmeister

  * r24073, r24126, r24128
    Branch: 1.1.x-issue-2751
    Fix rare FS corruption in both bdb and FSFS filesystem implementations
    Justification:
      Well, *corruption*...
