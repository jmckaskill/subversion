This file tracks the status of releases in the 1.6.x line.

See "Stabilizing and maintaining releases" in trunk/www/hacking.html for
details on how release lines and voting work, what kinds of bugs can
delay a release, etc.

Status of 1.6.1:
================

Candidate changes:

  * r36613, r36615, r36631, r36641
    Avoid potential segfault when dealing with subtree mergeinfo.
    Justification:
      One user reported a segfault due to the way, prior to this change, that
      we set children_with_mergeinfo elements to NULL rather than removing
      the elements from the array, see
      http://svn.haxx.se/dev/archive-2009-03/0382.shtml.
    Notes:
      While segfaults are serious, this one is not sufficient by itself to
      hold up 1.6.0 given that it is not a regression from 1.5.x, no one has
      been able to produce a reproduction recipe, and only one user has
      reported it (and they were able to work around it).  The fix itself is
      r36613, r36631, and r36641.  r36615 is a variable renaming change that
      is necessary to avoid a conflict.

 * r36178
   External merge-tool improvements.
   Justification:
     Makes automated merging easier, and also fixes a bug where a file
     which should be marked conflicted was consired sucessfully merged
     because the tool's exit status was not properly evaluated.
   Notes:
     The bug is only triggered when using an external merge tool with the
     --accept=launch option. I don't think we need to hold 1.6.0 on this.
   Votes:
     +1: stsp (I'd say it's a fix for a feature we already support (merge
               under control of external non-interactive tool), albeit
               the feature is currently so buggy that you can't use it.)
     
 * r36509
   Don't contact the server asking about implicit mergeinfo when the
   explicit mergeinfo tells us all we need to know about what to merge
   and what not to.
   Justification:
     Avoids needless communication with the server in some use cases.  For
     users with lots of subtree mergeinfo and slow network connections
     the performance improvement should be quite significant.

 * r37009
   Recommend SQLite 3.6.12.

     -0: gstein (the release is a week old; let's see at least another week
                 or two behind it before modifying the 1.6.x recommendation)


Approved changes:
=================

 * r37045, r37053
   Fix issue #3391 'excluding absent dir segfaults'.
   Justification:
     This issue was introduced in 1.6.x.
   Notes:
     r37045 is the actual fix. r37053 is a follow up which improves the
     'if' condition that checks for switched paths.

 * r36389-r36390, r36412, r36421, r36423, r36964
   Instead of verifying the pristine copy of a file before updating it, 
   calculate and verify the used text base (base/revert/copied) stream while
   applying the delta using the new stream checksum api. It also enables the
   verification of files where the workingcopy has no recorded checksum.
   Justification:
     This allows verifying and updating pristine files in a single pass, where
     we used two separate passes over the pristine file before.
     This enhances update performance on large files and most likely reduces
     the amount of work on-access virusscanners do on our files.
   Notes:
     r36389 contains the actual change. r36412 is a code cleanup patch.
     r36421,r36423 re-enable checking pristine files when apply_textdelta
     doesn't send a base checksum. (neon and serf before r36422).
     r36390 is a space before paren cleanup of update_editor.c needed for a
     clean merge.
