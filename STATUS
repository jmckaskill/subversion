Status of 1.5.0:
================

Candidate changes:

 * r29632
   Add optional pool parameter to the Editor methods missing it, matching
   the rest (not to mention the C API!).
   Votes:
     +1: epg

 * r30761, r30762
   Fix for issue 3172.
   Notes: 'log -g' fails the moment it encounters a bogus mergeinfo which 
     claims a merge from a non-existentpath@REV1-REV2.
   Votes:
     +1: kameshj, arfrever

 * r30820
   Fix pool issue which definitely can lead to assertion failures in
   reintegrate, and quite possibly to other mergeinfo corruption.
   Votes:
     +1: glasser, epg

 * r30843
   Fix abort in ra_serf when server sends invalid xml during replay.
   Votes:
     +1: lgo

   Votes:
     +1: danielsh

 * r30852
   Fix test backported in r30838 but not adjusted to still use 1.5
   test suite API.
   Branch:
     1.5.x-tests-pass
   Notes:
     If we roll another rc after rc4, it must include this backport.
     (The previous broken backport was not in rc4, though.)
