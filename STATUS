This file tracks the status of releases in the 1.6.x line.

See "Stabilizing and maintaining releases" in trunk/www/hacking.html for
details on how release lines and voting work, what kinds of bugs can
delay a release, etc.

Status of 1.6.0:
================

Candidate changes:

  * r36093, r36292, r36406
    Improve some messages.
    Votes:
      +1: arfrever
      +1: gstein, rhuijben (for 1.6.1; this can wait)

  * r36209
    Update paths to svnmucc.
    Votes:
      +1: arfrever
      +1: gstein, rhuijben (for 1.6.1; this can wait)

  * r36388
    Recommend Neon 0.28.4.
    Votes:
      +1: arfrever, steveking (already using neon 0.28.4 in TSVN)
      +1: gstein, rhuijben (for 1.6.1; this can wait)
     
Candidate if a new tarball is constructed (otherwise for 1.6.1):

 * r36049-r36051, r36131
   Resolve the SVN_ERR_MALFUNCTION() reproducible on Windows with
     svn ci "C:/Program FIles" C:/Windows
   by handling parent directories correctly.
   (r36050 and r36050 are typo fixes; r36131 some extra cleanup)
   Justification:
     This malfunction makes update_tests.py 32 abort on Windows. Which in turn
     delays the Windows automated testrun until a user confirms.
     (This doesn't fix this testcase; it just handles this part of the problem)
   Votes:
     +1: rhuijben, pburba, steveking
     +1: gstein (for a new CODE tarball, not a doc tarball)

 * r36159
   Fix proxying of LOCK and UNLOCK requests via WebDAV proxies.
   Justification:
     With the fix, each slave server tries to field the lock/unlock, resulting
     in competing ideas of what is and isn't locked.
   Votes:
     +1: cmpilato, rhuijben, arfrever
     +1: gstein (for 1.6.1)

  * r36238
    Fix build of RHEL5 RPM packages.
    Justification:
      Won't build properly without these changes.  Not a release blocker for
      1.6.0 but would be nice if the train is still in the station.  Otherwise
      please feel free to move to 1.6.1.
    Votes:
       +1: dws, arfrever
       +0: gstein (for 1.6.0)
       +1: gstein (for 1.6.1)

  * r36252-36253 (on branch 1.6.x-r36252)
    Fix valgrind UMRs.
    Justification:
      UMRs are undefined behaviour
    Votes:
      +1: philip, rhuijben, stsp, arfrever
      +1: gstein (for a new CODE tarball, not a doc tarball)
      
  * r36302
    Fix a small problem in the loggy upgrade process. Some v10 working copies
    have .svn/format, and some don't. The *intent* is to remove the file if
    present, so make the code match.
    Justification:
     If change-svn-wc-format.py is used to downgrade a working copy
     from 1.6 to 1.5 format, the script does not add the format file,
     rendering 1.6 clients unable to update the working copy again:
     "svn: Can't remove file '.svn/format': No such file or directory"
     Since the presence of that file has been deprecated for ages,
     let's just apply this easy fix to 1.6 instead of tweaking the script.
    Votes:
      +1: rhuijben, stsp, arfrever
      -0: gstein (for 1.6.0 since it isn't "needed" except for when somebody
                  uses a script which I conceptually disagree with)
      +1: gstein (for 1.6.1)

  * r36213
    Trivial help output fix.
    Justification:
      Errors in documentation are bad, obvious fix.
    Notes:
      Already merged to 1.6.x by Arfrever in r36214, but reverted
      in 36322 because it was not formally voted on.
    Votes:
      +1: stsp, arfrever
      +1: gstein (for 1.6.1; it can wait)


Status of 1.6.1:
================

Candidate changes:

 * r36178
   External merge-tool improvements.
   Justification:
     Makes automated merging easier, and also fixes a bug where a file
     which should be marked conflicted was consired sucessfully merged
     because the tool's exit status was not properly evaluated.
   Notes:
     The bug is only triggered when using an external merge tool with the
     --accept=launch option. I don't think we need to hold 1.6.0 on this.
   Votes:
     -0: rhuijben (Looks like a feature enhancement for a patch release)
     +1: stsp (I'd say it's a fix for a feature we already support (merge
               under control of external non-interactive tool), albeit
               the feature is currently so buggy that you can't use it.)

 * r36256
   Fix potentially awful performance of --ignore-ancestry merges.
   Justification:
     A very simple change which avoids an unneeded walk of the entire merge
     target.  For large WCs the performance improvment can be dramatic.
     See http://svn.haxx.se/dev/archive-2009-03/0067.shtml.
   Votes:
     +1: pburba, rhuijben, gstein

 * r36444
   Optimize merge performance when dealing with subtree mergeinfo.
   Justification:
     Another simple change which, in many common situations, avoids unneeded
     communication with the server for each subtree with explicit mergeinfo.
     If the merge target has many subtrees with mergeinfo, the performance
     improvment can be dramatic, see
     http://svn.haxx.se/dev/archive-2009-03/0198.shtml.
   Votes:
     +1: pburba, rhuijben
     
 * r36149-r36151, r36156
   Fix starting apache httpd in daemon mode from python versions with
   win32process support. (Found after upgrading my python to 2.6.1)
   Justification:
     Without this fix I can't run the testsuite as non-admin after
     installing 2.6.1.
   Notes:
     r36149 and r36150 contain the actual fix and r36151 and r36156 clean up
     the mess I left after performing only partial commits.
   Votes:
     +1: rhuijben

 * r36509
   Don't contact the server asking about implicit mergeinfo when the
   explicit mergeinfo tells us all we need to know about what to merge
   and what not to.
   Justification:
     Avoids needless communication with the server in some use cases.  For
     users with lots of subtree mergeinfo and slow network connections
     the performance improvement should be quite significant.

     +1: pburba
