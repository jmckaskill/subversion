This file tracks the status of releases in the 1.4.x line.

See "Stabilizing and maintaining releases" in trunk/www/hacking.html for
details on how release lines and voting work, what kinds of bugs can
delay a release, etc.

Status of 1.4.0:
================

Candidate changes:
      
  * r19919
    Fix SVN_CONFIG_NICE to work with autoconf 2.60-dev CVS and prereleases,
    which clobber configure arguments in AC_INIT. 
    Justification:
      Developer convenience throughout the lifetime of 1.4.x.
      Note that affected versions are already packaged within Debian etch.
    Concerns:
      Adds a config.nice.old file that has no relevance to this fix.

  * r20040, r20255, r20256
    RPM changes to correctly build on x86-64 architecture.
    Justfication:
      Quite a few user requests and also RPMs should work on all architectures.

  * r20041
    Get rid of requirement for another RPM package (chrpath) to build the
    Linux RPM packages.
    Justification:
      Using Fedora Core as an example, I figured out a better
      way to simplify build package requirements with patch instead of
      package.

  * r20042
    Improve usability for Svn::Core::Dirent#time in the SWIG/Ruby bindings
    by converting its returned value from a Integer to a Time.

      Improves usability for the bindings.

  * r20461, r20469, r20470, r20473, r20476
    Port RPMs to APR/APR-UTIL >= 0.9.7 (0.9.12)

      Unbreak RPM build on 1.4.x branch.

  * r20180, r20187
    Finish Apache 2.2/APR 1.x build/test support for Win32.
    Justification:
      Low impact and fixes some build and test issues with Win32 and
      Apache 2.2.

  * r20166
    Add install-swig-rb-doc make target.
    Justification:
      Improves usability for the bindings around documentation.
    Votes:
      +1: nori

  * r20248
    Improve usability of Svn::Core::Dirent in the SWIG/Ruby bindings
    by adding a method, Svn::Core::Dirent#have_props?.
    Justification:
      Adds only one alias and improves usability for the bindings.
    Note:
      Depends on r20225 - merge conflicts unless this revision is not merged.

      +1: nori

Approved changes:

  * r20125
    ra_serf: Be more tolerant when updating a WC file without a delta base.
    Justification:
      Certain operations (switch) will cause a WC to invalidate the version-url
      parameter and causes ra_serf to crash on a subsequent update to that file.

      +1: jerenkrantz, rooneg, cmpilato

  * r20170
    Don't carry around our own Visual Studio project files for Apache/APR --
    they only worked for APR 0.9.x and the user can manually convert them.
    Justification:
      Low impact and needed for Apache 2.2 compatibility.
    Votes:
      +1: djh, rooneg, dlr

  * r20218, r20428
    Move away from using pools to manage bdb environments, since it
    results in unpredictable behavior during shutdown due to pool 
    destruction ordering issues.
    Justification:
      Unpredictable behavior is bad.
    Votes:
      +1: rooneg, jerenkrantz, cmpilato

  * r20225
    Additional documentation for Ruby bindings
    Justification:
      Documentation is always good and the revision only adds docs.
    Note:
      Depends on r20042 - merge conflicts unless this revision is not merged.
    Votes:
      +1: blair, nori

  * r20270
    Add two log commands required by loggy merge as added in r20313.
    Justification:
      Porting to 1.4.x prevents a wc-format bump later.
    Votes:
      +1: dionisos, rooneg, cmpilato

  * r20301, r20353
    Improve visibility of the "--version" option; fix quirks in parsing it.
    Justification:
      Users are happy if they can reasonably find a description for the
      "--version" option.
    Votes:
      +1: dionisos, nori, cmpilato

  * r20340 (and r20313)
    Fix issue #1914: update runs diff3 twice
    Justification:
      With external diff3, without this chance, we can produce incorrect
      merge result reports (G instead of C) because internal and external
      diff tools can give different results.
    Note:
      r20340 depends on r20313 and 20270
    Votes:
      +1: dionisos, rooneg, cmpilato

  * r20382
    Fix status when a file is both added and conflicted.
    Justification:
      Small fix.  Low risk.
    Votes:
      +1: rooneg, dionisos, nori, dlr

  * r20395
    Don't error out during status due to inconsistent EOL styles in working
    copy files.
    Justification:
      Regression from 1.3.x.
    Votes:
      +1: lundblad, dlr, cmpilato

  * r20400
    Update the SWIG ignore information for new svn_io.h and svn_path.h
    functions added for 1.4 (and for 1.3 too, since we forget to do that
    before).
    Justification:
      Avoid exporting broken and/or unsupported wrappings of functions to the
      bindings.
    Votes:
      +1: maxb, cmpilato

  * r20423
    Re-order the arguments of svn_txdelta_to_svndiff2(), a new API in 1.4,
    so that they meet our conventions of:
      - output parameters come first
      - pool comes last
    Justification:
      - Users of our APIs are not confused.
      - The SWIG bindings don't need to use a different argument ordering
        to the C API.
    Notes:
      As this is an API change, it CANNOT be delayed to 1.4.1, and if for
      any reason it should be rejected, it needs to be reverted from trunk.
      Please vote for this quickly, to minimize the window in which there is
      an API mismatch between trunk and the 1.4.x branch - thanks!
