This file tracks the status of releases in the 1.4.x line.

See "Stabilizing and maintaining releases" in trunk/www/hacking.html for
details on how release lines and voting work, what kinds of bugs can
delay a release, etc.

Status of 1.4.0:
================

Candidate changes:

  * r20781
    autogen.sh: Purge *.pyc files from the build/ hierarchy after using the
    build generator, so that we do not ship them in tarballs.
    Justification:
      Shipping detritus like .pyc files in release tarballs is sloppy.
    Votes:
      +1: maxb
      -1: cmpilato (this is a very odd place to do this.  dist.sh, perhaps?)

  * r20190, r20250, r20444, r20826
    A few improvements to the Windows build system including a fix for the
    swig perl bindings.  They are grouped together to avoid conflicts.
    Justification:
      Most are very low impact build improvements, but without r20826 the
      Perl bindings won't build on Windows.
    Votes:
      +1: djh, brane (r20826 only from email),
          pburba (r20190, r20444, r20826)
      +0: dlr, pburba (r20250)

  * r20172, r20828
    Update the Windows build instructions.
    Justification:
      Documentation that more closely matches the reality is good.
    Votes:
      +1: djh, dlr

  * r20833, r20836 (depends on r20190 group above)
    Provide named, separate debug information files for clients building
    against Subversion libraries.
    Justification:
      Very low impact and silences hundreds of warnings about missing debug
      information when linking to Subversion libraries.
    Votes:
      +1: djh
      +0: dlr, cmpilato

  * r20834, r20864
    Fix issue #2583: 'svn diff' shouldn't require write access
    to the working copy.
    Justification:
      Low impact change restoring previous behavior.
    Votes:
      +1: dionisos, dlr

  * r20874
    Improve the output from svnsync to use the correct verb tense, to
    not abbreviate unnecessarily, to report that properties were copied
    successfully, and to (in general) more closely match output from our
    other binaries.
    Justification:
      Our output text is a form of API.  If we don't fix this stuff now,
      we're stuck with it for a while.
    Votes:
      +1: cmpilato, dlr

  * r20879, r20880
    Fix segfaults caused by faulty svnsync user input.
    Justification:
      Segfault.  Duh.
    Votes:
      +1: cmpilato
