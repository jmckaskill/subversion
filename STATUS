Candidate changes for 1.5.1:
============================

 * r31313
   Make all ra layers return a consistent error when a path is not
   found in the repository.
   Notes:
     Small change, but API consistency is always a good thing.
     Does not merge cleanly!
   Question:
     Does r32056, nominated below, fix these test failures?
   Votes:
     +1: lgo, cmpilato
     +0: arfrever (serf tests fail)
     -0: markphip (serf tests fail on OSX), epg (failure confirmed)


 * r30632, r30749, r30750, r31757, r31769, r31817
   Fix issue #3174, 'Merge algorithm chokes on subtrees needing special
   attention that have been renamed'.
   Justification:
     File merges that encounter this problem break, the fix is fairly simple,
     and directory merges already have the equivalent fix in 1.5.0.
   Notes:
     r31817 is the core fix for the issue, the other revision relate to
     a new test and some subsequent tweaks for to it.  Note that r31769 is
     nominated in the issue #3067 group too as it touches both issues.
     There are several minor conflicts when backporting this group to 1.5.x.
     To facilitate review a backport branch was created at
     http://svn.collab.net/repos/svn/branches/1.5.x-issue3174.
   Votes:
     +1: pburba, cmpilato
     +0: markphip (ran all tests, including all bindings and serf)


 * r31786
   Fix the Ruby bindings test failures: Normalize compared value.
   Votes:
     +1: kou, cmpilato


 * r30607, r30628, r30812, r30929, r30935, r30961, r30967, r31033,
   r31059, r31086, r31088, r31090, r31137, r31575, r31594, r31601,
   r31769, r31900, r31926, r31927
   Fix issue #3067: subtrees that don't exist at the start or end of a merge
   range shouldn't break the merge.
   Justification:
     This fixes a serious bug in which common merge use cases fail with an
     error.  We have already encountered this in our own repository.
     See http://subversion.tigris.org/issues/show_bug.cgi?id=3067#desc5
     onward for the tortured history and explanation of this problem.
   Notes:
     r31594, r31601, r31900, r31927 are the core fixes for this issue.

     r30628 some format only changes that are needed to avoid conflicts.

     r31059, r31086, r31088, r31090, r30607, r30812, r30929, r30935,
     r31575, r31769, r31926 add/tweak/expand
     merge_tests.py coverage of this issue.  Note that r31769 is also
     nominated in the issue #3174 group as it applies to both issues (and may
     already be backported).

     r30961, r30967, r31033, and r31137 are code and documentation improvements
     to some merge.c helper functions, needed to avoid conflicts.

     There is a backport branch with all these changes applied at
     http://svn.collab.net/repos/svn/branches/1.5.x-issue3067.  Note that
     you'll want to use a trunk (or 1.5.x-issue3067) build to merge
     1.5.x-issue3067 to 1.5.x or you'll encounter some problems, see
     http://subversion.tigris.org/servlets/ReadMsg?listName=dev&msgNo=141164.

 * r32056
   Fix ra_serf bug that has a potential to cause vague errors when
   location-segments report is run against non-existent node, exhibited
   at trunk@31900 via merge_tests failures.
   Votes:
     +1: kameshj


 * r31658, r31659
   Fix a remaining bug with issue #2825, Handle --depth option for 'merge'
   operations in terms of both content and mergeinfo.
   Justification:
     An inoperative merge to a directory at --depth files should set
     non-inheritable mergeinfo on the merge target and 'normal' mergeinfo
     on any of the target's file children.  Without this fix the file
     children get no mergeinfo set/updated.  This is a fairly minor bug, but
     it is inconsistent with the way we currently handle inoperative merges
     in every other situation (i.e. we still set mergeinfo - see issue #2883).
   Votes:
     +1: pburba


 * r32153, r32160, r32185, r32237
   Fix issues #3220 (log -g is slow) and #3235 (log -g is wrong).
   Justification:
     Slowness is bad -- in some tests, this fix decreased the cost of a log -g
     run from about 6 minutes to around 12 seconds.  And the old code only
     gets slower as more instances of mergeinfo appear in the repository.
     Wrongness is bad -- and I don't even need to explain this.
   Notes:
     When merging r32153, use the "theirs" version of all conflicts which
     appear to be in the new functions fs_mergeinfo_changed() and 
     get_combined_mergeinfo_changes().  "--accept theirs-conflict" did the
     right thing for me (cmpilato) as of r32155.

     +1: hwright (all but r32237)
     +1: cmpilato (r32237 via IRC), pburba


 * r32164, r32169
   Fix a segfault in the python tests.
   Justification:
     Segfaulting tests are a Bad Thing.  This appears to be a regression
     from 1.5.0.

     +1: hwright
