This file tracks the status of releases in the 1.2.x line.

See "Stabilizing and maintaining releases" in trunk/HACKING for
details on how release lines and voting work, what kinds of bugs can
delay a release, etc.

Status of 1.2.1:
================

Candidate changes:

  * r14859, r14923, r14939
    Branch: 1.2.x-r14859 
    Fix bug where an unlocked file loses its executable bits when
    svn:executable is set.
    Justification:
      Buggy interaction between locking and svn:executable.
    Votes:
      +1: lundblad
      +1: fitz (for original r14859 @ trunk)

  * r14774, r14849, r14851, r14862, r14893, r14898, r14905, r14947
    Fix locking bug when working on a switched file in the wc and
    a bug when locking an URL with URL-encoded characters in the path.
    Justification:
      Old behavior caused the wrong file to be locked and locking of URLs
      with spaces and non-ASCII characters to not work.
    Notes: 
      14774 is the commit of the test, 14849 is the fix, the rest are 
      refinements.
      Without r14898, this introduces a regression on locking paths
      with "funny" characters.
      Use 1.2.x-r14774 branch.
    Votes:
      +1: fitz (except r14893, r14898, r14905 and r14947)
      +1: lundblad

  * r14830
    Fix of the Windows Installer's Add/Repair/Remove capabilities.
    Branch:
      innosetup-hsuninsfix-5x-1.2.x (-r14715:14716)
    Justification:
      This fixes problems people had when using Windows'
      add/remove item in the Control Panel.
    Notes:
      Use backport branch because tree-reorganization defeats a simple
      merge from trunk.
    Votes:
      +0: dlr (concept, no testing environment), fitz (concept)

  * r14116, r14722, r14759
    Optimize 'svn log' performance.
    Justification:
      The new --limit option does not help speed as much without this.
    Notes:
      r14722 depends on r14116, which is just comment fixes.
    Votes:
      +1 (not r14116): djh
      +1: lundblad, fitz

  * r14885
    Python bindings, fix for functions returning MD5 digests.
    Justification:
      Small change, potentially useful, 1.3 is quite some way off.
    Votes:
      +1: maxb
      
  * r15016
    Fix partly broken caching of copyfrom information in fsfs.
    Justification:
      Performance regression with svn log -v for revisions with many paths
      added without history (i.e. an initial import).
    Votes:
      +1: lundblad, dlr
