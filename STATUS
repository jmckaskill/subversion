Status of 1.7.3:

Candidate changes:
==================

 * r1147540, r1147541
   Remove unused variables in build system.
   Justification:
     Backporting of future changes will be easier.
   Votes:
     +1: arfrever
     -0: stsp (we can backport these when we need to)
     -0: gstein

 * r1210147, r1202132, r1202333, r1220740
   Fix the 'svn log --diff' code so that it correctly shows a diff of a
   target file (or directory) that was at a different path in the past.
   Previously it would error out. A test is included.
   Branch:
     ^/subversion/branches/1.7.x-r1210147
   Notes:
    Depends on the r1220783 bug fix, otherwise the test will fail on Windows.
    r1210147 is the actual fix.
    r1202132 and r1202333 were merged for conflict resolution. These revisions
    depend on the issue #2873 fix which has been backported in 1.7.2
    r1220740 expands the test so that it would fail without r1210147 applied.
   Votes:
     +1: stsp (without r1220740 -- r1220740 depends on r1220783 which
               in turn needs new-in-1.8 APIs. Are there test failures
               on Windows without it that cannot be fixed some other way?)
     +1: julianfoad

 * r1235831, r1236099
   Tweak the parsing of the ssl-authority-files config option to make it
   easier for users to configure.
   Justification:
     Low impact change to help users.
   Notes:
     Both r1235831 and r1236099 conflict and will need a branch.
   Votes:
     +1: gstein
     +1: rhuijben (r1236099 only)

 * r1146762, r1201419, r1227237, r1227250, r1227352, r1227372, r1227384,
   r1227385, r1239382, r1239631, r1239655, r1239749 
   Fix issue #4059, "can't commit when copy-op-root and copied-along
   grandchild are explicit targets".
   Justification:
     Some copies can't be committed. Users complained.
   Branch:
     ^/subversion/branches/1.7.x-issue4059
   Notes:
     r1146762 avoids a semantic conflict
     r1201419 adds a regression test
     r1227237 is a comment fix
     r1227250 is an indentation fix
     r1227352 is merged to avoid a conflict and improves an error message
     r1227372 is a follow-up test fix for previous
     r1227384 prepares the actual fix and needs --accept=mine-conflict
     r1227385 is the actual fix
     r1239382 fixes the problem for nested copies, too
     r1239631 and r1239655 are follow-up comment fixes
     r1239749 fixes a performance regression on the backport branch
   Votes:
     +1: stsp, rhuijben

 * r1238121
   Fix incorrect url construction in libsvn_ra_serf when svn_ra_get_dir2() is
   called against a HTTPv2 server with a SVN_INVALID_REVNUM revision.
   Justification:
     Privately reported as AnkhSVN issue.
   Votes:
     +1: rhuijben, philip

 * r1241530, r1241713, r1241726
   Fix the python bindings for svn_auth_get_platform_specific_client_providers.
   Justification:
     The bindings should see passwords cached in the platform-specific providers.
     Already fixed for the Perl bindings.  Ruby fix is nominated separately.
   Notes:
     r1241713 and r1241726 tweak the unit test.
   Votes:
     +1: danielsh

 * r1241553
   Fix the ruby bindings for svn_auth_get_platform_specific_client_providers.
   Justification:
     The bindings should see passwords cached in the platform-specific providers.
     Already fixed for the Perl bindings.  Python fix is nominated separately.
   Votes:
     +1: stsp

 * r1242116
   Fix erratum ra001.
   Justification:
     The fix is directly relevant to documenting 1.7.x's behaviour.
   Votes:
     +1: danielsh

 * r1242337
   Fix potential write beyond buffer during base64 decoding.
   Justification:
     Potential memory corruption, although much less likely than on trunk.
   Notes:
     Test won't compile but isn't necessary as it doesn't trigger the problem
     on 1.7.  Do a subtree merge of svn_base64.c.
   Votes:
     +1: philip

Veto-blocked changes:
=====================

 * r1146131 and followups
   Add svn_fs_verify() and implement rep-cache verification in FSFS using it.
   Branch:
     1.7.x-fs-verify
   Justification:
     Would be nice to extend verify already in 1.7.x.
   Notes:
     This does not include progress reporting; that has been postponed to 1.8.
   Conflicts:
     On fs_fs.c.  Resolve with 'theirs-conflict'.
   Votes:
     +1: danielsh, rhuijben
     +0: gstein (progress would be nice) (without r1161164, r1161180)
     -0: cmpilato (For a function with this name, the implementation is far
         too anemic. I'd prefer this be a private function in 1.7.x, leaving
         room for a future public API that really does full verification.)
         (without r1161164, r1161180)
     -1: danielsh (invasive, new feature)

 * r1220783
   Fix mis-ordered text output of 'svn log --diff' on Windows.
   Justification:
     Badness within 'svn', fixed within 'svn'. Needed for r1210147 group.
   Notes:
     Doesn't compile on 1.7.x.
   Votes:
     +1: julianfoad, rhuijben
     -1: stsp (doesn't compile and would need new-in-1.8 public APIs).

 * r1221463
   Allow leading "r" in ?p= query string arguments.
   Justification:
     Same as for allowing '-r r42' in svn(1).
   Votes:
     -0: rhuijben (Behavior change without positive votes? 1.8?)
     -1: cmpilato (a rollback to an earlier patch release would break any
                   bookmarks saved for URLs using the new syntax)
