Status of 1.7.1:

Candidate changes:
==================

 * r1146131 and followups
   Add svn_fs_verify() and implement rep-cache verification in FSFS using it.
   Branch:
     1.7.x-fs-verify
   Justification:
     Would be nice to extend verify already in 1.7.x.
   Notes:
     This does not include progress reporting; that has been postponed to 1.8.
   Conflicts:
     On fs_fs.c.  Resolve with 'theirs-conflict'.
   Votes:
     +1: danielsh, rhuijben
     +0: gstein (progress would be nice) (without r1161164, r1161180)
     -0: cmpilato (For a function with this name, the implementation is far
         too anemic. I'd prefer this be a private function in 1.7.x, leaving
         room for a future public API that really does full verification.)
         (without r1161164, r1161180)

 * r1147540, r1147541
   Remove unused variables in build system.
   Justification:
     Backporting of future changes will be easier.
   Votes:
     +1: arfrever
     -0: stsp (we can backport these when we need to)
     -0: gstein

 * r1163243, r1163383
   Fix issue #3791 'svn mergeinfo shows natural history of added subtrees
   as eligible'.
   Justification:
     The 'svn mergeinfo [ -R | --depth [ files | immediates | infinity ] ]'
     subcommand gives incorrect answers in some use cases.
   Notes:
     r1163243 is a test for the issue, r1163383 is the fix.
   Votes:
     +1: pburba

 * r1164426, r1164614
   Fix STMT_SELECT_NODE_CHILDREN_WALKER_INFO for correctness and speed.
   Justification:
     Recursive info and propset don't scale well with large working copies
     and may possibly act on the wrong nodes.  Correctness discussion:
     http://colabti.org/irclogger/irclogger_log/svn-dev?date=2011-09-02#l214
     On a Linux machine with a Subversion trunk working copy on a local disk
     running 'svn info --depth infinity' shows it to be 2 or 3 times faster.
     On a larger working copy it's orders of magnitude faster.
   Votes:
     +1: philip
     +0: peters, gstein (looks correct, but I didn't test, and while
                         performance should be better, I wonder if that's
                         been tested at all)

 * r1167681
   Don't invoke quicksort unnecessarily when combining mergeinfo rangelists.
   Justification:
     This speeds up --reintegrate merges, especially the pathological case
     described here: http://svn.haxx.se/dev/archive-2011-09/0247.shtml
   Votes:
     +1: stsp, rhuijben

 * r1176915
   Improve handling of temporary allocations in svn_mergeinfo_intersect2().
   Justification:
     Should reduce memory footprint.
   Votes:
     +1: stsp, hwright

 * r1178280, r1178282
   Add a sanity check to FSFS.
   Justification:
     Detects a user-visible corruption seen on svn-master.apache.org.
   Votes:
     +1: danielsh

 * r1153540, r1153566
   Silence a build warning.
   Votes:
     +1: danielsh, hwright

 * r1181609
   Fill in the repos_* fields of svn_wc_status3_t for nodes that only exist
   in the repository.
   Justification:
     Resolves a regression identified by markphip.
   Votes:
     +1: rhuijben

 * r1182115
   Update references to subversion.tigris.org in INSTALL.
   Justification:
     "If you tell the truth you don't have to remember anything."
     --- Mark Twain
   Votes:
     +1: danielsh

 * r1178942, r1182527 
   Fix issue #4009, "Big trivial text files merged MUCH slower than binary"
   Justification:
     Much improved merge performance for, well, trivial text file merges!
   Votes:
     +1: stsp

 * r1182904, r1182909
   Print an error message if a working copy upgrade fails due to bad MD5
   base checksums, rather than asserting.
   Justification:
     Should reduce amount of spurious TortoiseSVN assertion reports on users@.
     Invalid on-disk data does not merit an assertion.
   Votes:
     +1: stsp, danielsh
