This file tracks the status of releases in the 1.5.x line.

See "Stabilizing and maintaining releases" in trunk/www/hacking.html for
details on how release lines and voting work, what kinds of bugs can
delay a release, etc.

Note: Because we anticipate a reasonable amount of new development
will still be required for Subversion 1.5, we are for the time being
applying the "somewhat looser voting system for areas that are not
core code" to the entire branch.

Status of 1.5.0:

 * r30004
   Fix the client-side problem described in issue #2382
   Justification: Without this fix, clients cannot connect reliably
     to svnserve daemons running on IPv4/IPv6 dual-stack hosts,
     or IPv4-only hosts with multiple A records. See the issue for details.
   Notes: #2382 is a long-standing issue. It was rediscovered
      by Stefan KÃ¼ng in http://svn.haxx.se/dev/archive-2008-03/0585.shtml
