Candidate changes for 1.5.2:
============================

 * r32409
   Fix an incompatibility with BSD make, which was introduced in r24293.
   Justification:
     Trivial fix. Fixes out-of-tree build of the bindings on BSD.
     Might help downstream packagers for these systems.

 * r32672, r32673, r32674, r32739
   Fix an inconsistency in parsing svn:externals with the new 1.5
   relative URL support when both a relative URL and a relative path
   is used with -r N.  Also, add stricter checking on svn:externals.
   Justification:
     If an 1.4 style external with -r N and an absolute URL is changed
     to use a relative URL, then svn will not parse the URL as a URL
     any more but as the target directory, which is odd and
     inconsistent behavior.  The code without this fix does not match
     the documentation on the web site.

 * r32706, r32707, r32730
   Fix another issue #3067 bug where subtree mergeinfo can occur that
   breaks the merge editor drive.
   Notes:
     r32706 is a new test, r32707 is the fix.  r32730 is an obvious
     fix (comment formatting tweak).
   Justification:
     We've already encountered this problem in our own repository when
     trying to synch up the fs-rep-sharing branch with trunk (sorry no
     thread to reference, only discussed in IRC but the new test in r32706
     shows how it can happen).

Approved changes:
=================

 * r31867, r32365
   In the "Malformed URL for repository" error message, show the URL.
   Justification:
     Trivial change that may shed light on a bug that we can't reproduce
     that's been hitting several people - see the email thread
     <http://svn.haxx.se/dev/archive-2008-06/0939.shtml>.
