Status of 1.6.6:
================

Candidate changes:

 * r37478, r37543, r37544, r37545, r37547
   Support using `svnversion` on files and improve some messages printed by
   `svnversion`.
   Justification:
     Some messages printed by `svnversion` are inconsistent and sometimes
     incorrect:
     $ svnversion /usr
     exported
     $ svnversion /bin/ls
     '/bin/ls' not versioned, and not exported
     $ svnversion VERSIONED_FILE
     'VERSIONED_FILE' not versioned, and not exported
     $ svnversion /nonexistent
     subversion/libsvn_wc/questions.c:90: (apr_err=2)
     svn: '/nonexistent' does not exist
     ^^^
     Messages with these revisions backported:
     $ svnversion /usr
     Unversioned directory
     $ svnversion /bin/ls
     Unversioned file
     $ svnversion VERSIONED_FILE
     NUMBER
     $ svnversion /nonexistent
     '/nonexistent' doesn't exist

 * r38004, r38014, r38028, r38122
   Make KWallet window attached to terminal window.
   Justification:
     Without this change, KWallet window can appear behind terminal window
     and is left after killing terminal.

     -0: psamuelson, stsp (without r38122) (code is ugly and Linux-specific -
                                            would getenv("WINDOWID") work
                                            instead?)

 * r38417, r38424
   Fix issue #3443 'Obtaining implicit subtree mergeinfo hammers merge
   performance'
   Justification:
     If a merge target has "large" numbers (100's or 1000's) of subtrees
     with explicit mergeinfo, then this change can result in dramatic
     performance improvements, see example described in
     http://subversion.tigris.org/issues/show_bug.cgi?id=3443#desc1
   Notes:     
     Also see http://svn.haxx.se/dev/archive-2009-07/0149.shtml for
     discussion of this change.

     +1: pburba, arfrever

 * r38142, r38267, r38269, r36788, r37129, r37521, r37591, r37523, r38195,
   r38247, r38325, r38349, r38352
   Fix issue #3432 'Merge can record mergeinfo from natural history gaps'
   Justification:
     Gaps in merge sources can lead to the creation of invalid mergeinfo
     or the removal of valid mergeinfo.
   Notes:     
     The fix itself in r38325 is relatively simple, but recent refactoring
     of the merge code on trunk makes it look a lot worse than it is.
     Unless otherwise noted, all of the following are nominated simply to
     avoid a conflict nightmare:
     r38142, r38267, r38269 - New test and test tweaks for the issue.
     r36788 - Comment changes only.
     r37129 - Scope reduction of a pool.
     r37521 - Minor bug fix and some refactoring.
     r37591 - Comment changes only.
     r37523 - Merge code refactoring.
     r38195 - Pool use cleanup, no functional change.
     r38247 - More merge code refactoring.
     r38349 - Variable rename to avoid shadowing a previous local.
     r38352 - Remove an unused variable.

 * r38000, r38006, r38099, r38100, r38181
   Don't break the working copy when a tree-conflict features an incoming
   replace.
   Justification:
     My colleagues and some clients are really annoyed by this problem.
     Although it's been fixed, it is not in 1.6.x yet, which is met with
     little understanding. Releasing 1.6.5 without this patch would
     probably be some bad publicity...
   Notes:
     If a merge has a delete followed by an add on the same node, and
     also that node is modified locally, svn tried to create two tree-
     conflicts on the same node. That hit an assertion and bailed out,
     breaking the working copy.
     The cmdline test for this issue is merge_replace_causes_tree_conflict
     in merge_tests.py, should become nr. 133.
     (My `make check' with these revisions merged to 1.6.x is clean)

         (not properly fixed; test passes for wrong reasons; see
         <http://subversion.tigris.org/ds/viewMessage.do?dsForumId=462&dsMessageId=2384930>)

 * r35958, r36030, r38373, r38836, r38837, r38842
   Several fixes to the Win32 exception handler. This change also makes it
   available on Windows Vista and 7 where it was previously blocked by a
   version check.
   Justification:
     This exception handler is a valuable debugging tool for users who don't
     have development tools installed. (Most users on Windows).
   Notes:
     Most of these revisions cancel out each other. The real changes are in
     r38373 (removing version check) and r38836,r38842 (fixing formatting
     specifier). It's probably easier to review the combined patch than the
     individual revisions.
     A backport branch exists as ^/branches/1.6.x-r38836.
   Votes:
     +1: rhuijben
     +0: pburba - I don't have a Vista or Win7 box to try this out on, but it
         works fine on my XP box.

 * r38850
   Fix remaining part of Issue 3453: Building Subversion 1.6 requires GNU grep 2.5.
   Votes:
     +1: arfrever, stsp

 * r38851, r38875, r38881
   Fix Issue #3458: Use '$SED' instead of 'sed'.
   Notes:
     There are 2 trivial merge conflicts in configure.ac. The first (in Expat
     detection code) should be resolved with 'mc'. The second (with AC_PROG_SED)
     should be resolved with 'tc'.

     +1: arfrever, stsp

 * r38872
   Improve "Attempt to add tree conflict that already exists" error message.
   Justification:
     This error is being seen in the wild, possibly due to the problem the
     r38000 group is trying to fix. This change makes it easier to find
     out which .svn directory is causing the problem by printing its path
     as part of the error message.

     +1: stsp

 * r38927
   Fix issue #3281, "Merge a replacement of a directory".
   Justification:
     The result of a merge replacing a directory cannot be committed
     without this fix.
   Notes:
     There is a backport branch at ^/branches/1.6.x-r38927.
     See issue #3281, the issues linked from there, and the huge commment
     added in r38927 on trunk for more information.
   Votes:
     +1: stsp, gstein

 * r38886
   Fix 2 failing tests in ruby bindings.
   Justification:
     1.6.5 shipped with these failures by accident. Failing regression tests
     can confuse packagers or other people who want to verify their freshly
     compiled binaries using our regression test suite.
