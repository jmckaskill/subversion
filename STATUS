Status of 1.6.1:
================

Candidate changes:



Approved changes:
=================

 * r35977
   Remove the implicit recanonicalize in svn_path_url_add_component2 that
   should have been part of r35732 that started asserting its behavior.
   Justification:
     Stops recanonicalizing +- everywhere. (Is by far the most CPU intensive
     part of svn update before the ra session is opened). All inputs are
     guaranteed to be pre-canonicalized.
