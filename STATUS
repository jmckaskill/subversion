Status of 1.1.0:
================

Candidate changes:

  * r10599
    Make the perl bindings tests work before the svn libs have been installed.
    Justification:
      Trivial, obviously correct fix.
    Votes:
      +1: maxb, ghudson

  * r10604
    Cleanup some qsort-related stuff.
    Justification:
      Removes *4* redundant functions, but adds a new API.
    Votes:
      +1: cmpilato

  * r10616, r10638, r10642
    Work around directory creation bug in APR shipped with httpd 2.0.50.
    Justification:
      Not a tiny patch, but most of the pieces are simple and
      independent.  Bug breaks shared working copies and litters
      unsightly sticky bits around people's working copies and
      repositories.
    Votes:
      +1: ghudson, maxb, lundblad

  * r10645
    Add new abbreviation 'Revision' for 'LastChangedRevision'.
    Justification:
      Tiny patch. Drastically eases conversion from CVS for repositories
      using $Revision$ and wanting to continue to use it for subversion - 
      a simple propset, rather than text changes to every affected file.
      Patch has been filed in the issue for more than a year!
    Votes:
      +1: maxb, cmpilato

  * r10652, r10673
    Fix missing UTF-8 -> native recoding in 'svn log' output.
    Justification:
      Solves user experience in very common operation.
    Backporting result:
      Merge without conflicts (at r10652).
    Votes:
      +1: dionisos, cmpilato

  * r10674
    Make ./configure behave nicer in the presence of old Apache.
    Justification:
      Tiny patch. If a user has an old apache on their system, but didn't ask
      us to use it, we shouldn't abort ./configure, just don't use it.
