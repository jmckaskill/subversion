Status of 1.2.0:
================

Candidate changes:

  * r13983
    Correct valid warnings and bogus compilation errors specific to
    Jikes.
    Justification:
      Avoid warnings (and hard errors!), improve compile times.
    Votes:
      +1: dlr, kfogel

  * r14024
    Allow automated tests for the javahl bindings to be run before the
    bindings have been installed.
    Justification:
      Encourages hacking on the bindings, and improves user confidence.
    Votes:
      +1: dlr

  * r14041, r14149, r14186, r14194
    Fix issue #2268 (svn update of xml-unsafe dir (from within) http error)
    and similar problems regarding paths with leading or trailing spaces.
    Justification:
      Yet Another Path Escaping Bug

  * r14063, r14066, r14068, r14079, r14121, r14124
    Branch: 1.2.x-r14063
    Fix FSFS locking problem.
    Justification:
      Issue #2265 can cause data loss.
    Notes:
      The backport branch removes the svn_fs_initialize() API, since
      that was contributing some disruption on trunk related to
      --enable-dso.  For practical purposes, the best-effort
      initialization of the common pool and mutex should be fine.

  * r14180
    Make the public locking API semantics for lock expiry match the internal
    storage and known concerned caller's semantics.
    Justification:
      Removes needless double-conversions, and solves the, "Does apr_time_t
      represent a moment in time or a span of time?" question.  Only affects
      APIs new to 1.2, so this is a chance to avoid some future baggage.
    Votes:
      +1: cmpilato, lundblad

  * r14177
    Add svn_ra_initialize() API.
    Justification:
      We can't add this in 1.3 and require it being called.
    Votes:
      +1: lundblad

  * r14183
    Fix crash in the javahl binding, when using the Notify2 interface.
    Justification:
      Small javahl binding only fix to prevent crash of javavm.
