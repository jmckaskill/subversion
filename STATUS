Status of 1.2.4:
================

Candidate changes:

  * r14646
    Allow users to "make clean" without running Makefile.PL.
    Justification:
      Trivial fix.
    Votes:
      +1: djames

  * r15906, r15941
    Favour "python" over "python2", if "python" is Python 2.x.
    Branch: 1.2.x-r15906-r15941
    Justification:
      Allows Python bindings to build correctly when the user upgrades
      the standard "python" binary to Python 2.4, but leaves the
      nonstandard "python2" binary as Python 2.2.
    Notes:
      In the 1.2.x-r15906-r15941 branch, I merged r15906 and r15941
      from trunk. I did not include the changes in r15906 which affect
      autogen.sh, because the changes to autogen.sh can wait until
      Subversion 1.3.

  * r15943, r15967, r16050
    Improve portability of the build system for Python bindings, so that
    they will work out of the box in a variety of build setups.
    Branch: 1.2.x-r15943-r15967-r16050
    Justification:
      Improves portability.
    Notes:
      Branch solves a trivial merge conflict.

  * /branches/1.2.x-issue-2388
    mod_authz_svn bugfix: commiting empty revisions incorrectly
    authorized.
    Justification:
      Unauthorized users can pollute revision space with empty
      revisions or dangling transactions.
    Notes:
      See the original bug report at
      http://subversion.tigris.org/issues/show_bug.cgi?id=2388

  * r16829
    Fix svn_wc_dup_status2() to deep copy the "url" field.
    Justification:
      Refering to memory allocated in an old pool is bad, could cause
      crashes.
    Notes:
      We only want part of r16829, as it includes copying of some
      additional fields which do not exist in 1.2.x (the merge is
      trivial).

Approved changes (further review is welcome, but not required):

  * r15807
    Guard against NULL stream write calls.
    Branch: 1.2.x-r15807
    Justification:
      Affects Python bindings only. Prevents crashes when using
      ViewCVS with remote repositories.
