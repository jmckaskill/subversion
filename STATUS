  * r8867, r8868, r8902
    Trivial performance fix for mod_authz_svn; cache the access file per
    connection instead of reloading it per request.
    Justification: Saves at least 2 loads of the access file per update, plus
    an additional number of times equal to the number of entries in the REPORT
    response.
    Notes: Similar code has been present in mod_dav_svn to cache an open
    filesystem per connection.

      -0: kfogel  (Reviewed the change; it's not *so* trivial, and I'm
                   not sure an optimization like this belongs in a
                   patch release.)

  * r9861
    fixes reentrancy problem for javahl binding. The pool for a call could be
    destroyed before the end of the call. This could crash the jvm
    Justification: javahl binding only fix to prevent a crash

      +1: pmayweg

  * r9883, r9905
    Fix for crash in javahl binding. If the first parameter of SVNClient.list
    is null, the jvm will crash. r9905 is the result of a scan of the binding
    code searching for this problem in all possible places.

      +1: cmpilato

  * r8027
    Passing a Revision.DateSpec in javahl failed with 
    java.lang.NoSuchFieldError because java.util.Date.getTime() was 
    searched as a field when it is a method. 
    Justification: small change in javahl binding only

      +1: pmayweg

  * r9338, r9340
    Add various missing library dependencies to build.conf, for various
    binding-related stuff.
    Justification: Trivial change, correctness, needed to allow build of
    bindings on platforms with stricter linking requirements.

  * r10144
    Fix a crash caused by a race when getting status.
    Justification: Don't ever crash.  Requested by the TSVN folks
                   because the crash kills the whole Windows desktop.

  * r10186
    Allow COPY method on repositories with space in their name. (#1837)
    Justification: Embarrassing bug;  a one-line fix to mod_auth_svn.
