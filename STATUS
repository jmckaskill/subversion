This file tracks the status of releases in the 1.5.x line.

See "Stabilizing and maintaining releases" in trunk/www/hacking.html for
details on how release lines and voting work, what kinds of bugs can
delay a release, etc.

Note: Because we anticipate a reasonable amount of new development
will still be required for Subversion 1.5, we are for the time being
applying the "somewhat looser voting system for areas that are not
core code" to the entire branch.

Status of 1.5.0:
================

Candidate changes:

 * r29434, r29436, r29438
   Copy-on-update can use loggy incorrectly, and possibly lead to dataloss
   Notes: although the issue #2986 summary doesn't say so, r29438
          actually fixed a dataloss bug (a file could end up with
          properties that no one had ever intended to put on it).
          r29434 and r29436 are just regression tests for r29438.

 * r29155
   Allow packagers to build some parts of svn against installed svn libs.
   Votes:
     +1: epg

 * r29268, r29269, r29287, r29389
   Fix 'log -g'.
   Notes: Performance improvements may follow, but merging this is better
     than nothing (as 'log -g' is currently and completely broken on 1.5.x).

 * r29412, r29414, r29415
   Change DAV 'SVN-ACTION' log names (which are already being changed
   incompatibly in 1.5) to mesh with svnserve command names, instead of
   making up yet another vocabulary to describe SVN operations.

     -0: kfogel (see followup mail to r29412 commit email)

 * r29419
   Add an extra token to the revprops block in svnserve "replay-range"
   response.  Avoids a weird "malformed data" error in some cases (eg,
   SIGINTing an svnsync).
   Notes:
     Must be backported or reverted.

 * r29382, r29397, r29417
   A few changes to use the mergeinfo-api-cleanup types.
   Votes:
     +1: glasser

 * r29454:
   Remove the unused svn_rangelist_count_revs() API.
   Notes:
     This is an incompatible change; it must be backported or reverted.
     Dependent on r29269 (nominated above) which removes the last use
     of svn_rangelist_count_revs().

 * r29421, r29425:
   Enable PKCS#11 (smartcard) support in libsvn_ra_neon.
   Votes:
     +1: joe

 * r29422, r29423, r29426, r29429:
   Various ra_neon configuration handling fixes.
   Notes:        
     Conflicts if applied before r29421+r29425 (nominated above)
