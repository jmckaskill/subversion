This file tracks the status of releases in the 1.6.x line.

See "Stabilizing and maintaining releases" in trunk/www/hacking.html for
details on how release lines and voting work, what kinds of bugs can
delay a release, etc.

Status of 1.6.2:
================

Candidate changes:

 * r36613, r36615, r36631, r36641
   Avoid potential segfault when dealing with subtree mergeinfo.
   Justification:
     One user reported a segfault due to the way, prior to this change, that
     we set children_with_mergeinfo elements to NULL rather than removing
     the elements from the array, see
     http://svn.haxx.se/dev/archive-2009-03/0382.shtml.
   Notes:
     While segfaults are serious, this one is not sufficient by itself to
     hold up 1.6.0 given that it is not a regression from 1.5.x, no one has
     been able to produce a reproduction recipe, and only one user has
     reported it (and they were able to work around it).  The fix itself is
     r36613, r36631, and r36641.  r36615 is a variable renaming change that
     is necessary to avoid a conflict.

 * r36178
   External merge-tool improvements.
   Justification:
     Makes automated merging easier, and also fixes a bug where a file
     which should be marked conflicted was consired sucessfully merged
     because the tool's exit status was not properly evaluated.
   Notes:
     The bug is only triggered when using an external merge tool with the
     --accept=launch option. I don't think we need to hold 1.6.0 on this.
   Votes:
     +1: stsp (I'd say it's a fix for a feature we already support (merge
               under control of external non-interactive tool), albeit
               the feature is currently so buggy that you can't use it.)
     
 * r36509
   Don't contact the server asking about implicit mergeinfo when the
   explicit mergeinfo tells us all we need to know about what to merge
   and what not to.
   Justification:
     Avoids needless communication with the server in some use cases.  For
     users with lots of subtree mergeinfo and slow network connections
     the performance improvement should be quite significant.

 * r37009
   Recommend SQLite 3.6.12.
   Votes:
     +1: arfrever, rhuijben
     -0: gstein (the release is a week old; let's see at least another week
                 or two behind it before modifying the 1.6.x recommendation)

 * r37072, r37083
   Fix issue #3392 'Parsing error with reverse merges and non-inheritable
   mergeinfo'
   Justification:
     Can cause repeat merges to break in the presence of non-inheritable
     mergeinfo.
   Notes:
     r37072 is a test for the issue, r37083 is the fix.
   Votes:
     +1: pburba

 * r37121
   Fix test_dirent_get_absolute for the case where the current directory
   on C: is C:/.
   Justification:
     The dirent code should not rely on svn_path rules, especially when the
     dirent functions were added to resolve these issues.
   Votes:
      +1: rhuijben

 * r37137
   Make some sweeping pool lifetime fixes in the BDB backend.
   Justification:
     Bringing 'svn ls -v' over HTTP on a directory with 10000 files
     from 2Gb+ of RAM to under 400Mb is a very good thing.
   Votes:
     +1: cmpilato

 * r37156
   Make default depth of merge infinity, rather than the depth of target.
   Justification:
     Is it technically a bug?  Dunno, but there is nothing but confusion
     regarding the old behavior, see
     http://svn.haxx.se/dev/archive-2009-04/0328.shtml and
     http://svn.haxx.se/dev/archive-2009-03/0701.shtml.

     +1: pburba

 * r37160, r37163, r37175
   Fix issue #3396, "status --quiet doesn't show tree conflicts".
   Justification:
     Tree conflict victims are not shown in status output even though
     they should be.
   Notes:
     r37160 fixes the bug, r37163 and r37175 fix tests.
     IMPORTANT: r37163 depends on r37156 to be merged first to merge
     without conflicts, *and* for the tests to pass!
     So don't bother merging this group before r37156.
   Votes:
     +1: lgo, arfrever
     +1: stsp (r37160 and r37163 only) 

 * r37169
   Update --set-depth infinity should expand shallow subtrees.
   Justification:
     update --set-depth infinity won't actually update the target's
     shallow subtrees without this change.

     +1: pburba
