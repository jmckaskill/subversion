Status of 1.1.2:
================

Candidate changes:

  * r11483 (Issue #2091)
    Unitialized variable on Win98.
    Justification:
      It was causing random failures for our Win98 users.  The fix
      also correctly sets the locale path now, making locale stuff
      work as well.
    Notes: Change looks good to me.  I can't in good conscience +1
      it only because I don't have the environment to test nor the
      docs to review the MultiByteToWideChar() call.  -kfogel

  * r11215, r11264
    SVN has needed a good packaging script for Win32 since forever.
    Justification:
      This and the related build and test script changes will make
      creating 1.1.x Win32 binary packages a lot easier.
    Note: This depends on other changes not mentioned above; I'll
      develop the patch on branches/1.1.x-build.

  * r11439, r11669
    Fix slow "svn st" where the targets are files by not locking the whole
    anchor tree.
    Votes:
      +1: lundblad, dionisos
      (r11439 nominated by): Steve King

  * r11665
    Make FSFS commits work with insert-only perms on db/revs.
    Justification:
      This is a pretty straightforward order-of-operations change, is
      how I (Greg) always intended FSFS to work, and fulfills what has
      been a secondary goal of FSFS from the beginning.

  * r11047 (Issue #2032)
    Always call mkdir-init, even if we're not in a VPATH setup.
    Justification:
      Allows users to install JavaHL without manually creating
      directories to work around Issue #2032.

      Nominated by: David James <james82@gmail.com>

  * r11050
    Add install dependencies for libsvn_fs and libsvn_fs_base.
    Justification:
      Allows users to install JavaHL separately, without needing to
      compile and install the base subversion package.  Without this
      fix, JavaHL installation crashes in that case.

      Nominated by: David James <james82@gmail.com>

  * r11685
    Internationalization issues for the Windows Installer
    Justification:
      Keeping the installer in sync with actual 1.1.x Windows build.
      The Apache Server will not run on some systems w/o this merge.

  * r11689
    Ensure paths passed to external diff and diff3 commands are correct
    for a given platform.
    Justification:
      Without this, 'svn diff --diff-cmd' and 'svn merge --diff3-cmd' are
      broken on the Windows platform.
