Status of 1.4.7:
================

Candidate changes:

  * r21989, r22884, r23347-23349, r23357, r23359, r23363, r23364, r23384,
    r23385, r23387, r23395, r23763, r23764, r23794, r23795, r23799, r23807
    Bring mucc and mucc-test.py up to date with respect to trunk,
    except for r23427, which uses svn_stringbuf_from_file2() in 1.5.
    Justification:
      This is becoming a very useful tool for making restructuring
      commits that would otherwise require extremely large working
      copies.
    Notes:
      Blair ran mucc-test.py against this merge and it passed the
      test.  The person doing the merge should ensure that mucc-test.sh is
      deleted, as svnmerge.py skips that for some reason.  Also, if
      a test merge run is done with without committing and then
      reverting, then also delete the new mucc-test.py, since the
      next svnmerge.py will ignore it the second time around.

      +1: blair, cmpilato
      -0: glasser (while backporting mucc is a reasonable idea, it has changed 
           a lot since this was proposed, including changing its name; either
           don't backport at all or backport even more)

  * r25178, -461
    Fix issue 2712: If 'anon-access' is 'read' but anonymous access is
    disallowed via authz rules, updates/checkouts won't work, even for users
    with appropriate permissions.
    Justification:
      User reported problem, small fix, includes test.
    Branch: 1.4.x-r25178
    Votes:
      +1: vgeorgescu, sussman
      -0: glasser (the ra_svn protocol, even on trunk, is severely broken
           if you have anon-access=read and any read-authz-blocked paths;
           these revs only fix one of a large number of symptoms of this
           issue.  a better fix might be a way to tell your client not to
           log in ANONYMOUS even if it's an option)

Veto-blocked changes:

  * r21531, r21848, r21934
    Allow HTTP auth protocols to be configurable by way of a
    "http-auth-types" parameter.
    Justification:
      Allow GSSAPI/SSPI auth to be enabled/disabled on Windows with
      Neon 0.26.1+, addressesing numerous bug reports from
      TortoiseSVN, Subversion, Subclipse, etc.
    Votes:
      +1: dlr, djh, jerenkrantz
      -1: cmpilato (new features showing up in patch releases?  nuh-uh.)

Approved changes:

  * r28544
    Fix an important memory leak in the Python bindings.
    Justification:
      Simple patch. This serious memory leak probably affects every
      non-trivial script which uses the Python bindings.
