Candidate changes for 1.5.3:
============================

 * r32409
   Fix an incompatibility with BSD make, which was introduced in r24293.
   Justification:
     Trivial fix. Fixes out-of-tree build of the bindings on BSD.
     Might help downstream packagers for these systems.

 * r32790, r32796, r32798
   Fix issue #2505: make switch continue after deleting locally modified
   directories, as it update and merge do.
   Notes:
     r32796 updates the docstring.
     r32798 is an obvious fix.
   Justification:
     Small fix (with test).  User requests.

     +1: danielsh, zhakov

 * r31203
   Update build.conf to remove the magic word 'update' from the description to
   allow running the test as non-administrator on Windows Vista.
   Justification:
     Not a code change. Just makes it possible to run the tests as non-
     administrator without having to type your administrator password (or using
     a local patch).
   Votes:
     +1: rhuijben, zhakov

 * r32968, r32975
   Fix bug which occurs when a merge adds explicit mergeinfo to a subtree that
   had no explicit mergeinfo prior to the merge.  This new mergeinfo could
   obstruct any mergeinfo the path previously inherited and the new path
   was not getting mergeinfo set that described the merge itself -- See 
   http://subversion.tigris.org/servlets/ReadMsg?listName=dev&msgNo=142460.
   Notes:
     r32968 is a new test for this problem and r32975 is the fix.
   Justification:
     Incorrect mergeinfo results when this bug is encountered and it has
     already been encountered in our own repository as described in the
     aforementioned thread.

 * r32977
   Fix the current early bailout of 'svn log' as exhibited during
   `svn log -gq -r31828 file:///usr/local/svn/subversion'.
   Justification:
     Server logic fault tolerance.  Code mo'-betta-ness.

Approved changes:
=================

 * r31546
   Binding test fixes for Perl 5.10.
   Justification:
     Perl 5.10 is the current stable release.  The test was using some
     deprecate feature.
