Status of 1.2.0:
================

Candidate changes:

  * r14024
    Allow automated tests for the javahl bindings to be run before the
    bindings have been installed.
    Justification:
      Encourages hacking on the bindings, and improves user confidence.

  * r14626
    Fix testsuite bug which was causing the first two tests passed to
    run_tests.py to be silently ignored.
    Notes:
      Do I really need votes for a one-character obvious change? :-)
      Yes. >:->

Approved changes (further review is welcome, but not required):

  * r14612, r14614
    ra_dav bugfix:  make 'svn commit' work on locked files with propchanges.
                    r14614 adds a test for this bug.
    Justification:
      2 line change.  Stop trying to look up a property name in a hash mapping
      paths->lock_tokens.  It's redundant, and guaranteed to overwrite the 
      existing value with NULL.
