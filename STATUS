This file tracks the status of releases in the 1.6.x line.

See "Stabilizing and maintaining releases" in trunk/www/hacking.html for
details on how release lines and voting work, what kinds of bugs can
delay a release, etc.

Status of 1.6.0:
================

Candidate changes:
 
     
Candidate if a new tarball is constructed (otherwise for 1.6.1):

 * r36049-r36051, r36131
   Resolve the SVN_ERR_MALFUNCTION() reproducable on Windows with
     svn ci "C:/Program FIles" C:/Windows
   by handling parent directories correctly.
   (r36050 and r36050 are typo fixes; r36131 some extra cleanup)
   Justification:
     This malfunction makes update_tests.py 32 abort on Windows. Which in turn
     delays the Windows automated testrun until a user confirms.
     (This doesn't fix this testcase; it just handles this part of the problem)
   Votes:
     +1: rhuijben, pburba
     -0: gstein (replied with feedback on this rev.) (r36049 only) 

 * r36159
   Fix proxying of LOCK and UNLOCK requests via WebDAV proxies.
   Justification:
     With the fix, each slave server tries to field the lock/unlock, resulting
     in competing ideas of what is and isn't locked.
   Votes:
     +1: cmpilato, rhuijben
     +1: gstein (for 1.6.1)

  * r36238
    Fix build of RHEL5 RPM packages.
    Justification:
      Won't build properly without these changes.  Not a release blocker for
      1.6.0 but would be nice if the train is still in the station.  Otherwise
      please feel free to move to 1.6.1.
    Votes:
       +1: dws

  * r36252-36253 (on branch 1.6.x-r36252)
    Fix valgrind UMRs.
    Justification:
      UMRs are undefined behaviour
    Votes:
      +1: philip, rhuijben

  * <needs-branch>
    Remove all svn_uri_*() functions in svn_dirent_uri.h from our public 1.6,
    api to allow redefining and renaming these functions for 1.7.
    Justification:
      See discussion starting in http://subversion.tigris.org/ds/viewMessage.do?dsForumId=462&dsMessageId=1255935
      For 1.6 these functions are only used by the testset.
      (Issue #2028 is in progress for 1.7)
    Votes:
      +1: rhuijben

  * r36300
    'tr "[:lower:]" "[:upper:]"' is locale-dependent and can fail.
    Justification:
      Fixes build error seen on Solaris.
    Votes:
      +1: stsp

Status of 1.6.1:
================

Candidate changes:

 * r36178
   External merge-tool improvements.
   Justification:
     Makes automated merging easier, and also fixes a bug where a file
     which should be marked conflicted was consired sucessfully merged
     because the tool's exit status was not properly evaluated.
   Notes:
     The bug is only triggered when using an external merge tool with the
     --accept=launch option. I don't think we need to hold 1.6.0 on this.
   Votes:
     +1: stsp
     -0: rhuijben (Looks like a feature enhancement for a patch release)

 * r36256
   Fix potentially awful performance of --ignore-ancestry merges.
   Justification:
     A very simple change which avoids an unneeded walk of the entire merge
     target.  For large WCs the performance improvment can be dramatic.
     See http://svn.haxx.se/dev/archive-2009-03/0067.shtml.
