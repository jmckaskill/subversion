Status of 1.7.6:

Candidate changes:
==================

 * r1293945, r1293972, r1293976, r1293998, r1294136, r1294236;
   r1294134, r1294147, r1294586
   Two interdependent changes:
   Fix issue #4121: copy followed by delete of unreadable child.
   Fix svn:// authz in Python tests.
   Justification:
     User resorted to patching the commit editor to work around this.
     Tests are broken.
   Notes:
     r1293945,r1293972,r1293976 are cosmetics.
     r1293998 is the fix.
     r1294136 is a test.
     r1294236 fixes an uninitialized variable.
   Notes:
     r1294134 extends a test to demonstrate its brokenness.
     r1294147 fixes said brokenness.
     r1294586 fixes r1294147 for Windows.

     +1: danielsh, stsp

 * r1307177
   Move mod_dontdothat to install-tools.
   Justification:
     Undo compatibility break of 'make install' in 1.7.3.
   Votes:
     +1: danielsh, gstein

 * r1337441
   Fix XML namespace expansion in ra_serf
   Justification:
     Avoids segfaults caused by a malicious server sending unknown prefixes
     to ra_serf. (and corrects the semantics for a bonus win)
   Votes:
     +1: gstein, rhuijben

 * r1338810, r1339164
   Fix issue #4184 ("partial svnsync drops properties when converting
   copies to adds").
   Justification:
     Syncs that don't aren't synced at all.
   Notes:
     r1338810 taught the code to send properties for demoted copies.
     r1339164 fixed a theoretical use of uninitialized memory.
   Votes:
     +1: cmpilato, rhuijben

 * r1306275, and too many other revisions to list here
   New diff support code for added/deleted files and directories.
   Fixes issue #4153, "svn log --diff" on moved file gives "not found",
   and other problems.
   Justification:
     The current code (introduced in 1.7.x in the r1207351 backport commit)
     produces inconsistent paths in diff output (see
     http://svn.haxx.se/dev/archive-2012-03/0385.shtml), and it also breaks
     with the paradigm that the target of an editor drive may never have more
     than one path component (which according to cmpilato is an API violation).
   Notes:
     Please read the branch and related trunk log messages for detailed notes
     about these changes.
   Branch:
     ^/subversion/branches/1.7.x-issue4153
   Votes:
     +1: stsp

 * ^/subversion/branches/1.7.x-performance
   Use the working copy status walker as a first filter to find committable
   nodes.
   Justification:
     Huge performance boost. Especially on NFS.
   Notes:
     Backports the status walker framework. Many other parts are backportable
     too, but this branch delivers the plumbing.
   Votes:
     +0: rhuijben (I would like to see some test results before backporting)

 * r1341060
   Sort output of 'svn import'
   Notes: Needs a backport branch, noted here for completeness.
   Votes:
     +0: stsp (pending a proper conflict-free backport)

 * r1352068
   Do not use non-constant initializers in struct variables, since this
   violates C'89 and C'90.
   Justification:
     Fixes compatibility with SunPRO compiler.
   Branch: 1.7.x-r1352068 (just omits the changes where they are not
     applicable in 1.7.x, in three source files)
   Notes:
     r1352080 is an optional white-space follow-up.

     +1: julianfoad, rhuijben

 * r1353572
   Fix a bug in propset which could prevent updating cached values related
   to EOL expansion in wc.db.
   Justification:
     Incorrect behaviour, subtle working copy corruption.
   Votes:
     +1: stsp, rhuijben

 * r1354876, r1354907, r1355340
   Allow non-existing but valid canonical absolute paths to pass through
   svn_dirent_get_absolute().
   Justification:
     Resolves a few user reported problems.
   Notes:
     r1354907 undoes r1354876, and r1355340 fixes a return problem, so
     it is easiest to review them as a single patch.

=====================

Approved changes:
=================

 * r1351772
   Add missing new-in-1.7 notification API enum values to JavaHL.

 * r1341012, r1341076
   Sort 'svn status' output to avoid randomness in output with APR-1.4.6.

     order with APR-1.4.6 as a regression.

 * 1341031
   Sort output of 'svn proplist' to avoid randomness with APR-1.4.6

   Votes:
     +1: stsp, gstein, rhuijben

 * r1341034
   Sort output of 'svn propget -R' to avoid randomness with APR-1.4.6
   Justification:

     order with APR-1.4.6 as a regression.

   For issue #3962, fix example output of 'svn status' shown in 'svn

 * r1348822, r1349215
