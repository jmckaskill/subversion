This file tracks the status of releases in the 1.3.x line.

See "Stabilizing and maintaining releases" in trunk/www/hacking.html for
details on how release lines and voting work, what kinds of bugs can
delay a release, etc.

Status of 1.3.0:
================

Candidate changes:

  * r16350
    Fix issue #1911, where svndumpfilter generated invalid dumpfiles
    when copies occurred and --drop-empty-revs and --renumber-revs
    were in use.
    Justification:
      Invalid dumpfiles are not nice.
    Votes:
      +1: cmpilato, kfogel
      +0: dlr (concept, new to this area of the code)

  * r16793, r16798
    Correct and clarify doc strings related to the new WC/repository
    state APIs in svn_wc.h.
    Justification:
      The doc strings otherwise indicate the opposite of the actual
      behavior, and in one case, the wrong initialization value.
    Votes:
      +1: dlr

  * r16796
    Fix segfault possibility (introduced by the new WC/repository
    state APIs in r16344), which exhibits itself when the "svn:author"
    property has been deleted or does not exist.  This is a follow-up
    to r16784, which only corrected handling of directories (not
    files).
    Justification:
      Crashes are bad.  This repository state is easily achievable
      using propdel, or a DAV server which does not require auth.

Approved changes:

  * r16744
    Duplicate C object when converting to Ruby object.
    Justification:
      Prevent pool-related segfaults.
    Notes:
      Depends on r16754
