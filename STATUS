This file tracks the status of releases in the 1.4.x line.

See "Stabilizing and maintaining releases" in trunk/www/hacking.html for
details on how release lines and voting work, what kinds of bugs can
delay a release, etc.

NOTE:  This branch uses svnmerge.py for merge tracking.  Please familiarize
yourself with that tool if you plan to actually merge changes here.


Status of 1.4.1:
================

Candidate changes:

  * r21249, r21251, r21253, r21254
    Fix a bug in the svn_fs_closest_copy() implementations that caused
    confusing errors when tracing certain node locations.  See issue #2600.
    Notes:
      The bugfix is in r21254 -- all the others just add regression tests.

  * r21384, r21047
    A merge which results in a conflicted file in your WC should
    produce a "conflicted" merge notification.  'svn merge --dry-run'
    needs to be smarter about accessing the working copy (see issue
    #2584).

  * r21392
    Fix the Python bindings tests so that they use URLs which work
    on Windows.
    Branch: 1.4.x-r21392
    Votes:
      +1: djames

  * r21471
    Dramatically speed up WC to WC copy post commit processing by
    eliminating O(n^2) .svn/entries writing behaviour.
    Justification:
      Factor 10 speedups (see log message).
    Note:
      On trunk, this issue is solved with better memory bounding
      properties in r21616,r21619.

  * r21473
    Fix compile error when APR_HAS_DSO is not defined (e.g. on RISC OS).

      +1: dlr

  * r21531, r21848
    Allow HTTP auth protocols to be configurable by way of a
    "http-auth-types" parameter.
    Justification:
      Allow GSSAPI/SSPI auth to be enabled/disabled on Windows with
      Neon 0.26.1+, addressesing numerous bug reports from
      TortoiseSVN, Subversion, Subclipse, etc.

  * r21566, r21638, r21641, r21669, r21685, r21696, r21705
    Fix issue #2533, making 'svn status -u' show remotely changed
    properties on the root of a working copy.
    Justification:
      A user reported bug with a straightforward fix, plus regression
      test.
    Branch: 1.4.x-issue-2533
    Votes:
      +1: dlr, pburba

  * r21717
    Regression test for issue #2533, part of the r21566 group (but was 
    forgotten).
    Justification:
      Test for an issue fixed (if backported) in 1.4.x
    Votes:
      +1: lgo

  * r21657, r21662
    Fix issue #2602, making 'svn co URL@{DATE}' work.
    Justification:
      Brokenness.
    Notes:
      Revision should merge fine, but the regression test will get
      skipped (because there's no checkout_tests.py).  Test was
      introduced in r21275.
    Votes:
      +1: cmpilato, dlr

  * r21720, r21724, r21726
    Fix issue #2618: 'Checksum mismatch' error when receiving update for
    locally replaced-with-history file.
    Justification:
      Breaks working copy update; includes tests.
    Branch: 1.4.x-issue-2618
    Votes:
      +1: dionisos, zhakov

  * r21738, r21924
    Prevent an API violation from corrupting FSFS repositories, as seen
    in issue #2467 and reports from users.
    Justification:
      Silently corrupting the repository is a Bad Thing.
    Notes:
      Branch needed to avoid the backport of a new error code.
    Concerns:
      This isn't exactly a trivial fix.  We are also assuming that this
      is the cause of the corruption we've seen.

  * r21765, r21767, r21814
    JavaHL: Compile Java bytecode for the target platform of a Java
    1.2 JVM.
    Justification:
      The default target platform release number is typically equal to
      the compiling JDK version, which is likely much higher than our
      supported minimum runtime (Java 1.2).
    Votes:

  * r21770
    JavaHL: Fix a JVM crash when the empty string is passed to the
    checkout() method.
    Justification:
      SEGVs and JVM crashes are bad.

      +1: dlr

  * r20350, r20351, r20397, r20398, r21497, r21611, r21612
    Regression tests:
    - Test to validate that conflict markers now match the file's eol style
    - Test to validate that svn merge ignores whitespace when requested
      (-x -w option).
    - Test to validate that svn merge ignores eolstyle when requested
      (-x --ignore-eol-style option). 
    - Test that a copy of a directory (by URL) to a pre-existing
      directory (within the WC) copies the source *under* the target
      directory
    - Test if a repository with spaces in the name is accessible.
    Justification:
      Regression tests for issue added in 1.4.x or before.
    Branch: 1.4.x-r20350
    Votes:
      +1: lgo

  * r21897
    Add validation of the HEAD argument passed to 'svnmerge.py init'.
    Justification:
      This common gotcha otherwise results in an ugly stack trace with
      no meaningful feedback to the user.
    Votes:
      +1: dlr

  * r21904, r21919
    Stop requiring write access to a working copy when running
    'svn status --show-updates'
    Justification:
      Small change. Status is a read-only operation by design.
