for details on how release lines and voting work, what kinds of bugs can
delay a release, etc.

Status of 1.7.2:

Candidate changes:
==================

 * r1147540, r1147541
   Remove unused variables in build system.
   Justification:
     Backporting of future changes will be easier.
   Votes:
     +1: arfrever
     -0: stsp (we can backport these when we need to)
     -0: gstein

 * r1186944, r1186981, r1186983, r1187676
   Fix an assertion failure when a symlink is updated.
   Justification:
     Regression in 1.7.0.
   Notes:
     r1186944 is the actual fix, including a new test
     r1186981 fixes spurious failures of the new test
     r1186983 whitespace to avoid conflict
     r1187676 is a cosmetic follow-up tweak
   Votes:
     +1: stsp, philip

 * r1187695
   Have mod_dav_svn ignore non-Subversion POST requests.
   Justification:
     mod_dav_svn does not play well with others.
   Votes:
     +1: philip, rhuijben

 * r1188652, r1188677, r1188762
   Fix issue 4042, commit incomplete directory asserts.
   Justification:
     Regression from 1.6.
   Votes:
     +1: philip
     +0: rhuijben (Patch appears ok. Will bump to +1 after further review)

 * r1188774
   Fix issue #4044, "empty parents of externals not removed along with
   externals on update".
   Justification:
     Currently empty unversioned directories are left behind, possibly
     obstructing future updates which re-add the directory.
   Votes:
     +1: stsp
     -0: rhuijben (r1188774 checks if the defining directory must be removed 
                   instead of the parent directory of the external)

 * r1189261
   Bump copyright year in Windows executables and DLLs to 2011 (from 2009).
   Votes:
     +1: rhuijben, pburba

Veto-blocked changes:
=====================

 * r1146131 and followups
   Add svn_fs_verify() and implement rep-cache verification in FSFS using it.
   Branch:
     1.7.x-fs-verify
   Justification:
     Would be nice to extend verify already in 1.7.x.
   Notes:
     This does not include progress reporting; that has been postponed to 1.8.
   Conflicts:
     On fs_fs.c.  Resolve with 'theirs-conflict'.
   Votes:
     +1: danielsh, rhuijben
     +0: gstein (progress would be nice) (without r1161164, r1161180)
     -0: cmpilato (For a function with this name, the implementation is far
         too anemic. I'd prefer this be a private function in 1.7.x, leaving
         room for a future public API that really does full verification.)
         (without r1161164, r1161180)
     -1: danielsh (invasive, new feature)

Approved changes:
=================

 * r1189665
   Remove comma after last element of enum definitions.
   Justification:
     Unbreaks the build for some people.
   Notes:
     After merging, run:
     perl -pi -e 's/^(\s*svn_wc__db_kind_unknown), *$/\1/' subversion/libsvn_wc/wc_db.h
