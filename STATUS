This file tracks the status of releases in the 1.4.x line.

See "Stabilizing and maintaining releases" in trunk/www/hacking.html for
details on how release lines and voting work, what kinds of bugs can
delay a release, etc.

NOTE:  This branch uses svnmerge.py for merge tracking.  Please familiarize
yourself with that tool if you plan to actually merge changes here.

For example, to merge a number of revisions from trunk into branch,
you can use the svnmerge.py script that is in the branch.

$ contrib/client-side/svnmerge.py merge -r 21000-21006,21008,21876
$ svn diff
$ svn commit

Do not run svnmerge.py N separate times for each revision to merge
over, since svnmerge.py will not merge into a WC with uncommitted
changes.

Status of 1.4.3:
================

Candidate changes:

  * r19842
    Synchronize (and improve readability of) the various instances of our 
    license text + upgrade to 2006.
    Justification:
     Preparing to release 1.4.2 windows installer, license now on 1.4 branch
     is now difficult to read. Actual license text isn't changed.
    Votes:
     +1: lgo, dlr

  * r21516, r22155, r22224
    Fixes for the Windows installer script: add license files of the
    libraries, typos and copyright year.
    Justification:
     Preparing to release 1.4.2 windows installer.
    Votes:
     +1: lgo

  * r21531, r21848, r21934
    Allow HTTP auth protocols to be configurable by way of a
    "http-auth-types" parameter.
    Justification:
      Allow GSSAPI/SSPI auth to be enabled/disabled on Windows with
      Neon 0.26.1+, addressesing numerous bug reports from
      TortoiseSVN, Subversion, Subclipse, etc.

  * r21885, r22076
    Add a new RPM package for the AuroraLinux 2.0 SPARC distribution.
    Justification:
      It is a combination of RHEL3 and RHEL4 distributions with
      characteristics matching both, so we need a new directory.
    Branch: 1.4.x-r22076 (-r22079:HEAD)
    Votes:
      +1: dws
      -1: maxb (It appears that the auroralinux-2 directory has been based
                on an old version of the rhel-3 directory, pre-dating some
                of the difference-reduction work I did to try to minimize the
                unnecessary inconsistencies between the various distro
                flavours. Its introduction therefore represents a regression
                in the maintainability of the RPM packaging area as a whole.)

  * r22205, r22207, r22214
    subversion/tests/cmdline/davautocheck.sh improvements:
      Fallback to curl if wget is not available.
      Unset all proxy environmental variables for curl and wget.
    Justification:
      Nice for davautocheck.sh to work if:
        People are behind a firewall with PROXY set, or
        If they only have curl and not wget.
    Votes:
      +1: blair, dlr

  * r22253 through r22286
    svn-graph.pl: Update invocation of $ra->get_log() to account for
    the Perl API's $limit parameter.  Drastically improve UI and
    implementation.
    Justification:
      Incorrect API usage results in a completely broken script.  Old
      algorithm wasn't quite right, either.
    Notes: Copy r22286 from trunk to the 1.4.x branch.
    Votes:
      +1: dlr

  * r22329
    Report the first error found when parsing rule values from an
    authz file, rather than the last.
    Justification:
      This both returns a more useful error, and doesn't leak a bunch
      of errors in the middle.
    Branch: 1.4.x-r22329
    Votes:
      +1: dlr, lundblad

  * r22332
    Fix leak of space on the Perl argument stack when calling methods
    in a Perl class acting as a commit editor.
    Justification:
      Memory leaks are bad.
    Votes:
      +1: dlr

  * r22346, r22351, r22352
    Calculate checksums in ra_replay and repos_replay.
    Justification:
      Integrity checks for svnsync and SVK are good, and this
      is fixing things marked as "###".  While it's arguably
      a feature, is fully compatible and is more a matter of
      filling in unfinished work.
