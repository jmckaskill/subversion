  * r30503
    Fixes a minor bug When filtering self-referential mergeinfo from incoming
    property additions during a merge:  If the incoming property addition
    was simply empty mergeinfo, then that property got discarded.  No
    practical effect on the ultimate mergeinfo set by the merge, but the merge
    notifications were incorrect.  See
    http://subversion.tigris.org/servlets/ReadMsg?list=dev&msgNo=137120.
