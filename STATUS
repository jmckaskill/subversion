Status of 1.2.4:
================

Candidate changes:

  * r15807
    Guard against NULL stream write calls.
    Branch: python-bindings-improvements
    Justification:
      Affects Python bindings only. Prevents crashes when using
      ViewCVS with remote repositories.

  * r15906, r15941
    Favour "python" over "python2", if "python" is Python 2.x.
    Branch: 1.2.x-r15906-r15941
    Justification:
      Allows Python bindings to build correctly when the user upgrades
      the standard "python" binary to Python 2.4, but leaves the
      nonstandard "python2" binary as Python 2.2.
    Notes:
      In the 1.2.x-r15906-r15941 branch, I merged r15906 and r15941
      from trunk. I did not include the changes in r15906 which affect
      autogen.sh, because the changes to autogen.sh can wait until
      Subversion 1.3.

  * r15943, r15967, r16050
    Improve portability of the build system for Python bindings, so that
    they will work out of the box in a variety of build setups.
    Branch: 1.2.x-r15943-r15967-r16050
    Justification:
      Affects Python bindings only. Improves portability.
    Notes:
      Branch solves a trivial merge conflict.

Approved changes (further review is welcome, but not required):

  * r14782
    Fix a Perl variable scoping bug in contrib/client-side/svn_load_dirs.pl.in.
    Justification:
      Simple fix in a contrib script requested by a user.

  * r15888
    Complete issue #1361 for JavaHL, removing special handling in the
    JavaHL bindings for 'svn cat -r BASE' in favor of the
    implementation found in the libsvn_client library.
    Justification:
      Remove work-around, unnecessary since SVN 1.2.0, which incurs
      other problems (e.g. EOL-translations, etc.).
    Notes:
      The merge will need to be applied to the fileContent() method,
      rather than to the createReadStream() method (which is new in
      1.3).
      markphip:
      Applied to 1.2.3 tarball and verified that it fixes our problem in
      Subclipse.  We need to use svn cat to feed revisions to Eclipse GUI
      compare/merge engine.  Having incorrect line endings breaks it.

      +1 (non-binding): markphip
