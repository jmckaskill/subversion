This file tracks the status of releases in the 1.6.x line.

See "Stabilizing and maintaining releases" in trunk/www/hacking.html for
details on how release lines and voting work, what kinds of bugs can
delay a release, etc.

Status of 1.6.0:
================

Candidate changes:

 * r35930
   Adjust basic_tests.py 12 for compatability with Windows and Python 2.5+.
   Justification:
     Stops spurious test failures.
    Votes:
     +1: pburba
     +1: gstein (for 1.6.1)

 * r35943
   Avoid some tree_conflict_tests.py cleanup errors on Windows with BDB
   when building multiple sandboxes in the same test.
   Justification:
     Stops spurious test failures.
    Votes:
     +1: pburba
     +1: gstein (for 1.6.1)

 * r35950
   Make fsfs implementation of svn_fs_commit_txn adhere to API promises.
    Votes:
     +1: pburba
     +1: gstein (for 1.6.1)
     
 * r35967
   Add support to build and use SQLite amalgamation version on Windows.
   This change implements the same behavior as *nix build system does.
   Votes:
     +1: rhuijben, pburba (not strictly for 1.6.0)
     +1: gstein (for 1.6.1)

 * r35968,r35974
   Buffer overflow on ensuring a 0 byte string buffer
   Justification:
     This bug aborts our client if the OS catches it (bad) or overwrites
     arbitrary ram (worse). r35974 fixes the exact allocating behavior tested
     from the string tests.
   Votes:
     +1: rhuijben, gstein

Status of 1.6.1:
================

Candidate changes:

 * r35977
   Remove the implicit recanonicalize in svn_path_url_add_component2 that
   should have been part of r35732 that started asserting its behavior.
   Justification:
     Stops recanonicalizing +- everywhere. (Is by far the most CPU intensive
     part of svn update before the ra session is opened). All inputs are
     guaranteed to be pre-canonicalized.
   Votes:
     +1: rhuijben, gstein

 * r35981
   libsvn_ra_serf: Following RFC2617, verify authentication header tokens
   case insensitive.
   Justification:
     Enables using serf from behind Microsoft ISA proxy servers.
