This file tracks the status of releases in the 1.3.x line.

See "Stabilizing and maintaining releases" in trunk/www/hacking.html for
details on how release lines and voting work, what kinds of bugs can
delay a release, etc.

Status of 1.3.0:
================

Soak period:
  2005-11-30 - Begun with public announcement of rc4.
  2005-12-21 - Final week commences - critical backports only.
  2005-12-28 - Soak period elapsed!

Blocker:

  Wording specifically mentioning 'the plan for 1.3' is in the template
  post-lock and post-unlock hooks.  This would look ridiculous in a final
  1.3 release.

Candidate changes:

  * r17844
    Fix a bug in the assignment of out of date info to svn_wc_status2_t string
    members.  This problem has only been found with url, but it appears just as
    likely to affect ood_last_cmt_author.
    Justification:
      Without this change, the url and ood_last_cmt_author members of
      svn_wc_status2_t can be corrupted for out of date working copy items.
    Votes:
      +1 (non-binding): pburba

Approved changes:

Status of 1.3.1:
================

Candidate changes:

  * r17829, r17831
    Fix issue # 1456: Subversion RedHat RPMs have bad interaction with NFS
    server/client.
    Justification:
      Prevents spurious NFS and AUTOMOUNT messages in log files.
