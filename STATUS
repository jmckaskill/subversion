Status of 1.4.0:
================

Candidate changes:
      
  * r19919
    Fix SVN_CONFIG_NICE to work with autoconf 2.60-dev CVS and prereleases,
    which clobber configure arguments in AC_INIT. 
    Justification:
      Developer convenience throughout the lifetime of 1.4.x.
      Note that affected versions are already packaged within Debian etch.
    Concerns:
      Adds a config.nice.old file that has no relevance to this fix.

  * r20042, r20579
    Improve usability for Svn::Core::Dirent#time in the SWIG/Ruby bindings
    by adding another method, Svn::Core::Dirent#time2, which directly returns
    a Time instead of an Integer.
    Justification:
      Improves usability for the bindings.
    Note:
      r20579 depends on r20225, which depends on r20042.
