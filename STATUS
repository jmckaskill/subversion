This file tracks the status of releases in the 1.5.x line.

See "Stabilizing and maintaining releases" in trunk/www/hacking.html for
details on how release lines and voting work, what kinds of bugs can
delay a release, etc.

Note: Because we anticipate a reasonable amount of new development
will still be required for Subversion 1.5, we are for the time being
applying the "somewhat looser voting system for areas that are not
core code" to the entire branch.

  * r29742-r29744, r29746
    Tweak 'svn merge's support for merged adds to better support merges
    from foreign repositories.
    Notes: 'svn merge' has sorta half-supported merges from foreign
      repositories for a long time, but these changes may be the
      difference between this support really counting and not.  I
      believe this functionality would be extremely useful in vendor
      branch maintenance scenarios.  r29742 contains an errantly
      committed change.  r29743 is just the reversion of that errant
      change.  r29744 adds a test.  r29746 is a minor code clarification
      to r29472.

  * r29672
    Fix issue #3108, where the help for 'svn cl' indicated that a target path
    was required, but the code didn't enforce such.
