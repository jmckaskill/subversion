This file tracks the status of releases in the 1.7.x line.

See http://subversion.apache.org/docs/community-guide/releasing.html#release-stabilization
for details on how release lines and voting work, what kinds of bugs can
delay a release, etc.

Status of 1.7.0:

Candidate changes:
==================

 * r1146131 and followups
   Add svn_fs_verify() and implement rep-cache verification in FSFS using it.
   Branch:
     1.7.x-fs-verify
   Justification:
     Would be nice to extend verify already in 1.7.x.
   Notes:
     This does not include progress reporting, since that is nominated
     separately.
   Votes:
     +1: rhuijben (only for 1.7.0)
     +½: danielsh (not +1 since I nominated the change the same day I wrote it)
     +0: gstein (progress would be nice)

 * fs-progress branch
   Notes:
     Depends on the r1146131 group (1.7.x-fs-verify).
   Branch:
     fs-progress
   Justification:
     Provide feedback during 'svnadmin verify'.
     Avoid an API change in 1.8.
   Notes:
     If this proposal passes, the docstrings @since would have to be fixed
     in a new commit.
   Votes:
     +1: rhuijben (only for 1.7.0)
     +½: danielsh

 * r1147540, r1147541
   Remove unused variables in build system.
   Justification:
     Backporting of future changes will be easier.
   Votes:
     +1: arfrever
     -0: stsp (we can backport these when we need to)

 * r1154278, r1154379, r1154382
   Make 'svn ls' capable of listing Subversion 1.0-1.3 repositories using
   ra_serf.
   Justification:
     We promised not to break backwards compatibility and it is not nice
     that serf doesn't want to list the neon repository.
     (Check svn ls http://svn.webdav.org/repos/projects/neon/)
   Notes:
     r1154278 is a quick hack to detect old servers and to at least return
              some information.
     r1154379 is the real fix: fallback to a more compatible request.
     r1154382 makes sure the right result is used directly after falling
              back from svn_ra_serf__get_dir.
              (Most likely the problem is detected earlier than this function)
   Votes:
     +1: rhuijben

 * r1158187, r1158196, r1158201, r1158207
   Fix issues #2557 and #3987: 'svn info symlink/to/wc'.
   Justification:
     That syntax should work.
   Notes:
     Depends on the r1158193 group.
   Votes:
     +1: danielsh (without r1158187, so just the tests and not the fix)
     +1: rhuijben, cmpilato

  * r1158617, r1158875, r1158886, r1158896, r1158919, r1158924, r1158963
    Make 'svn revert' remove unversioned nodes resulting from reverting a copy.
    Fixes issue #3101.
    Justification:
      Bert suggested to backport this to 1.7.
      I myself am not really sure if we should consider this a bug fix
      or a behaviour change. I think we should merge this before 1.7.0
      if we decide to merge it.
      It does fix some fairly annoying usability issues.
      For instance: If a merge adds files, the merge result is reverted, and
      the merge is repeated, the second merge does not produce the same result
      as the first merge. It will skip the, now unversioned, files added by
      the first merge. There are various other cases where the unversioned
      files get in the way.
    Notes:
      All revisions depend on one another, but some amend or even undo changes
      made in earlier revisions. Instead of reviewing the individual commits
      I would suggest to run the following merge and review the resulting diff:
        svn merge -c1158617,1158875,1158886,1158896,1158919,1158924,1158963 \
          ^/subversion/trunk
    Votes:
      +1: stsp, rhuijben (but only if this gets into 1.7.0)

 * r1159132, r1159136, r1159148
   Make serf provide a sensible path for out of date items with HTTPv1 servers.
   Justifications:
     Bad errors are bad.
   Notes:
     r1159132 is a nonfunctional rename to make the code clearer.
     r1159136 is the real fix.
     r1159148 is a further cleanup (Not required, but makes patching easier)
   Votes:
     +1: rhuijben

 * r1159400
   Document a neat trick to better handle patch rejects in 'svn help patch'.
   Justification:
     Might save a poor soul from lots of manual copy-paste/editing some day.
   Votes:
     +1: stsp

 * r1160671, r1160682
   Resolve issue #3994, Subversion working copies that contain 'svn lock'-style
   locks cannot be upgraded.
   Justification:
     svn upgrade should not fail on perfectly valid working copies.
   Votes:
     +1: rhuijben

Veto-blocked changes:
=====================

Approved changes:
=================

 * r1158196, r1158201, r1158207, r1158209, r1158210, r1158217
   Fix another variant of issues #2557 and #3987: 'svnversion symlink/to/wc'.
   Justification:
     That syntax should work.
   Notes:
     r1158196, r1158201, r1158207 adds (and tweaks) the test for this problem.
   Notes:
     Tests fail.  Requires r1158187, which needs one more vote.
   Votes:
     +1: rhuijben, cmpilato
     +1 (once tests pass): danielsh

 * r1159760, r1159772
   Oops!  Swap some output variations that were keyed on
   reversed logic.  (--patterns mode was talking about "Path
   prefixes", while the regular path prefix mode was talking about
   "Path prefix patterns")
   Justification:
     Output mode should match execution mode, dontcha think?
   Notes:
     This is pretty close to being an "obvious fix", but let's get more eyes
     just in case I missed something.
