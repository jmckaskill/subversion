Status of 1.1.0:
================

Candidate changes:

  * r10604
    Cleanup some qsort-related stuff.
    Justification:
      Removes *4* redundant functions, but adds a new API.
    Votes:
      +1: cmpilato

  * r10645
    Add new abbreviation 'Revision' for 'LastChangedRevision'.
    Justification:
      Tiny patch. Drastically eases conversion from CVS for repositories
      using $Revision$ and wanting to continue to use it for subversion -
      a simple propset, rather than text changes to every affected file.
      Patch has been filed in the issue for more than a year!

  * r10674
    Make ./configure behave nicer in the presence of old Apache.
    Justification:
      Tiny patch. If a user has an old apache on their system, but didn't ask
      us to use it, we shouldn't abort ./configure, just don't use it.

  * r10704
    Fix problem with javahl throwing IllegalArgumentException, with no error
    off the caller.
    Justification:
      Small javahl binding only patch.

  * r10322, r10531
    Update bash_completion to include new command line options in 1.1.x
    Justification:
      It'd be nice if our bash_completion was as current as possible.
    Notes:
      Remove the changes to add the version command in r10531, we don't have it
      in 1.1.x.  So only --force would be added to add from the r10531 rev.

  * r10711
    Fix a non-portable temp file creation in SVN::Ra::Callback.  This
    triggers error on win32 ra_dav.
    Justification:
      Perl bindings only; win32 fixes.

  * r10438
    Replace references to APR_STATUS_IS_SUCCESS with a direct comparison
    either to zero or APR_SUCCESS.
    Justification:
      APR_STATUS_IS_SUCCESS is no longer defined in APR HEAD.
