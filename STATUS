Candidate changes:

  * r9861
    fixes reentrancy problem for javahl binding. The pool for a call could be
    destroyed before the end of the call. This could crash the jvm

  * r9883, r9905
    Fix for crash in javahl binding. If the first parameter of SVNClient.list
    is null, the jvm will crash. r9905 is the result of a scan of the binding
    code searching for this problem in all possible places.
    Justification: javahl binding only fix to prevent a crash

  * r8027
    Passing a Revision.DateSpec in javahl failed with 
    java.lang.NoSuchFieldError because java.util.Date.getTime() was 
    searched as a field when it is a method. 
    Justification: small change in javahl binding only

  * r9338, r9340
    Add various missing library dependencies to build.conf, for various

  * r10072
    Have 'svnadmin hotcopy' pass APR_LARGEFILE flag to apr_file_open().
    Justification:  allows this command to copy largefiles, regardless
                    of whether largefile support is compiled into APR.
    Notes:  many users have hit this problem (issue #1819).

  * r10616, r10638, r10642
    Work around directory creation bug in APR shipped with httpd 2.0.50.
    Justification:
      Not a tiny patch, but most of the pieces are simple and
      independent.  Bug breaks shared working copies and litters
      unsightly sticky bits around people's working copies and
      repositories.

  * r10819, r10855
    Avoid repository corruption if executed with closed std{in,out,err}
    Justification:
      Simple fix for a nasty problem that has bitten at least one user.

  * Issue #1862
