================

Candidate changes:

   * r16918
     Don't hardcode the packager's build directory in the release tarball.

   * r16929
     Fix parameter name in svn_wc_external_item_dup to be consistent with
     documentation.

       +1: djames, jerenkrantz
 
   * r16948
     Disable call to svn_wc__get_special() unless HAVE_SYMLINK defined.

   * r16953
     Fix regression in repos commit editor.
     Branch: 1.3.x-r16953
     Notes:
       svn_repos_get_commit_editor4 was introduced after 1.3.x was branched;
       affects only the added test.
     Justification:
       Breaks svk.

Approved changes:

   * r16903
     Remove dependencies on APR in the SWIG code and build scripts,
     that prevent running autogen.sh --release through to completion.
     Branch: 1.3.x-r16903
     Justification:
       We can't release a tarball that doesn't depend on SWIG without
       this, because apr.h is system-dependent.
     Notes:
       Change backported in branches/1.3.x-r16903 to resolve conflicts
       with regard to the altered build system in trunk.
     Followups: r16914, r16919, r16920, r16923, r16950
     Votes:
       +1: danderson, djames, jerenkrantz

   * r16914, r16919
     Remove unused and unnecessary portability typemaps from the SWIG
     bindings. Followup to r16903.
     Justification:
       Unused, invalid, and unnecessary portability typemaps can mislead.
     Votes:
       +1: djames, jerenkrantz

   * r16915
     Only allow SWIG 1.3.24 or 1.3.25.
     Justification:
       The SWIG bindings are not compatible with SWIG 1.3.26 or later.
     Votes:
       +1: djames, jerenkrantz, lundblad

   * r16920, r16923, r16950
     Define typemaps for APR datatypes in all SWIG bindings.
     Justification:
       Fixes check-swig-pl on 64 bit platforms.
       Fixes check-swig-rb.
     Depends: r16903
     Votes:
       +1: djames
       +1: kou (r16923 only)
       +0: jerenkrantz (too hacky; need a more portable solution)

   * r16930
     Tweak Perl bindings to avoid use of goto in svn_txdelta_apply.
     Justification:
       Prevents segfaults in the Perl test suite.
     Notes:
       The goto &function syntax can cause segfaults, if the supplied
       function is a SWIG/C wrapper.
