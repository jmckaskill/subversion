Status of 1.1.0:
================

Candidate changes:

  * r10599
    Make the perl bindings tests work before the svn libs have been installed.
    Justification:
      Trivial, obviously correct fix.

      +1: maxb, ghudson

  * r10604
    Cleanup some qsort-related stuff.
    Justification:
      Removes *4* redundant functions, but adds a new API.
    Votes:
      +1: cmpilato

  * r10645
    Add new abbreviation 'Revision' for 'LastChangedRevision'.
    Justification:
      Tiny patch. Drastically eases conversion from CVS for repositories
      using $Revision$ and wanting to continue to use it for subversion -
      a simple propset, rather than text changes to every affected file.
      Patch has been filed in the issue for more than a year!

  * r10674
    Make ./configure behave nicer in the presence of old Apache.
    Justification:
      Tiny patch. If a user has an old apache on their system, but didn't ask
      us to use it, we shouldn't abort ./configure, just don't use it.
    Votes:
      +1: maxb

  * r10704
    Fix problem with javahl throwing IllegalArgumentException, with no error
    off the caller.
    Justification:
      Small javahl binding only patch.
