This file tracks the status of releases in the 1.7.x line.

See http://subversion.apache.org/docs/community-guide/releasing.html#release-stabilization
for details on how release lines and voting work, what kinds of bugs can
delay a release, etc.

Status of 1.7.0:

Candidate changes:
==================

 * r1146131 and followups
   Add svn_fs_verify() and implement rep-cache verification in FSFS using it.
   Branch:
     1.7.x-fs-verify
   Justification:
     Would be nice to extend verify already in 1.7.x.
   Notes:
     This does not include progress reporting, since that is nominated
     separately.
   Votes:
     +0: danielsh
     +0: gstein (progress would be nice)

 * fs-progress branch
   Notes:
     Depends on the r1146131 group (1.7.x-fs-verify).
   Branch:
     fs-progress
   Justification:
     Provide feedback during 'svnadmin verify'.
     Avoid an API change in 1.8.
   Notes:
     If this proposal passes, the docstrings @since would have to be fixed
     in a new commit.
   Votes:
     +0: danielsh

 * r1147540, r1147541
   Remove unused variables in build system.
   Justification:
     Backporting of future changes will be easier.
   Votes:
     +1: arfrever

 * r1148083, r1148094
   Preload libsvn_auth_gnome_keyring and libsvn_auth_kwallet in locally built
   executables.
   Justification:
     Version mismatch errors would occur during trying to use locally built
     executables when a different version of Subversion was installed
     in /usr/lib.
   Votes:
     +1: arfrever, philip

 * r1148992
   Print error messages about failures of dynamic loading of libraries when
   SVN_DEBUG_DSO is defined instead of never.
   Justification:
     Suboptimal r1148374 was already backported in r1148488.
   Votes:
     +1: arfrever
     -0: rhuijben (A library shouldn't just write things to stderr. This needs
                   proper error handling instead. And besides I doubt anyone is
                   going to use this define (No veto!))
     -0: philip (changed my mind, I don't think this is needed on the branch)
     -0: stsp (Arfrever, can you please explain precisely what use case you
               have for this code? Why do you need it in the release, or
               on trunk, for that matter?)

 * r1149401
   Fail early when attempting to build swig-pl after configuring
   --without-swig.
   Justification:
     Convert mysterious error messages to a clean early exit.
   Votes:
     +1: danielsh, arfrever

 * r1149539
   Resolve issue #3969: provide proper cancellation support in the
   network loops in ra_serf.
   Justifications:
     GUI clients can't rely on EINTR being returned when a user tries to cancel
     an operation, as no signal is raised.
   Votes:
     +1: rhuijben

 * r1149627
   Adjust library order in build.conf for kwallet/gnome-keyring.
   Justification:
     Fixes "make install DESTDIR=..." which is used by packagers.  I suspect
     this is not a regression.
   Votes:
     +1: philip, danielsh

 * r1150242
   Make blame close its temporary files before deleting them.
   Justification:
     Hitting the io retry loop on windows is very painfull.
   Votes:
     +1: rhuijben
     
 * r1150327
   Report not finding txn roots produce a 404 error in mod_dav_svn.
   Justification:
     Removes unneeded errors that were suppressed before.
   Notes:
     This error is invisible to users without the r1150254 group.
   Votes:
     +1: rhuijben
     +0: danielsh
     
 * r1150254, r1150260, r1150261, r1150266
   Return errors by composing instead of ignoring them.
   Justification:
     Returning more errors makes it much easier to diagnose problems.
   Notes:
     This patchgroup contains a few patches that together enable seeing
     a few previous invisible error chains.
     r1150254: Improve error handling in svn_wc__internal_transmit_text_deltas.
     r1150260: Return txn unlock errors from fsfs.
     r1150261: Return txn abort errors when the editor decides to abort itself.
     r1150266: Return editor abort errors when the commit processing aborts.
   Votes:
     +1: rhuijben (after r1150302 and r1150327 are backported)
     +1: danielsh
     
 * r1150368
   Resolve an obscure locked file problem when aborting a commit.
   Justification:
     Transaction cleanup should succeed or temp files will accumulate
     on a server. And locks (the needle file) should be released as soon as
     possible.
   Notes:
     rhuijben: This bug triggered my weekend search for locked files problems.
   Votes:
     +1: rhuijben
     +0: danielsh (we shouldn't depend on libsvn_client fixes to avoid
                   accumulating tempfiles on the server)

 * r1150372
   When resolving to conflict-*, close the generated file before using it
   Justification:
     Copying unclosed/unflushed files is not nice and might cause all kinds
     of problems.
   Votes:
     +1: rhuijben, danielsh

 * r1150441
   Closing a translated stream should close the inner stream.
   Justification:
     Resolves an open file handle problem on inconsistent newlines.
     (And may cause different problems when behavior is attachted to stream
      close, like with checksum streams)
   Votes:
     +1: rhuijben, danielsh

 * r1150812
   Issue 3972, spurious revert notification on symlinks
   Justification:
     A regression from 1.6.
   Votes:
     +1: philip, stsp

Veto-blocked changes:
=====================

 * 1.7.x-neon-default branch
   Make neon the default http library.
   Justification:
     Serf isn't ready, new code not enabled, no proposal to enable it.
   Votes:
     +1: philip
     -1: gstein (I see no explanation for why "serf is not ready")


Approved changes:
=================

 * r1150302
   Avoid closing fs txns multiple times.
   Justification:
     We should follow our own api documentation.
   Notes:
     This error is invisible to users without the r1150254 group (upon which
     this revision depends for a clean merge).
   Votes:
     +1: rhuijben, danielsh, cmpilato
