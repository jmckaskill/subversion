Status of 1.3.1:
================

  * r17333 and associated test case (copied from trunk)
    Fix issue #2306: modification of "svn:needs-lock" should adjust
    the native file system's read-only attribute within a WC.
    Branch: 1.3.x-r17333
    Justification:
      Backport of a change to trunk which resolves buggy behavior on
      (at least) Windows and Mac OS X, behavior which is inconsistent
      with Linux.
    Notes:
      dlr does not have a Windows development environment, and thus
      cannot adequately test this change.  Additional testing is
      especially important given the heavy amount of modification
      which was necessary when backporting the change from trunk.

  * r17829, r17831
    Fix issue # 1456: Subversion RedHat RPMs have bad interaction with NFS
    server/client.  This was easily accomplished by just making a package
    change to set the -rpath correctly during package building.
    Justification:
      Prevents spurious NFS and AUTOMOUNT messages in log files.

  * r18144, r18164 and r18037, r18127 (only tools/dev/stress.pl)

  * r18215
    Enable Subversion's build system to use Neon 0.25.5.
    Branch: 1.3.x-r18215
    Justification:
      Distributions, such as DarwinPorts, have Neon 0.25.5 already and
      won't enable Subversion's WebDAV support without a patch.

  * r18230
    Fix a memory leak in the Python bindings which causes Trac resync to use
    massive amounts of memory for large repositories.
    Justification:
      Without this fix, Trac can't handle extremely large repositories.
    Notes:
      See http://projects.edgewall.com/trac/ticket/2620

  * r18247
