This file tracks the status of releases in the 1.5.x line.

See "Stabilizing and maintaining releases" in trunk/www/hacking.html for
details on how release lines and voting work, what kinds of bugs can
delay a release, etc.

Status of 1.5.0:
================

Candidate changes:

 * r30643, r30653, r30785
   Update bash completion script.
   Votes:
     +1: arfrever, stylesen

 * r30883, r30888
   Fix issue #3187.  Fix reverse merges where merge target or subtree
   has non-inheritable revision ranges intersecting with the merged
   range.  Not a common use case, but completely broken without this
   fix.
   Notes:
     r30888 is just a revert of some accidental whitespace changes
     in r30883.  This group changes the svn_rangelist_intersect API.
     If this group isn't backported for 1.5.0 it needs to be
     reverted on trunk and svn_rangelist_intersect() revved.
   Votes:
     +1: pburba, markphip, kfogel

 * r30746, r30747
   Fix a minor merge range notification header bug.
   Notes:
     r30747 is just cleanup of some cruft that snuck in with r30746,
     thus adhering to my "every commit should need a follow-up" ethos.
   Votes:
     +1: pburba, markphip

 * r30896, r30905
   Make Cyrus SASL client support DIGEST-MD5 (at the very least).
   Notes:
     r30896 was a bad attempt, but required for r30905 to apply
     cleanly.

     +1: glasser, markphip

 * Remove exit_code from the return tuple of the function call
   to svntest.actions.run_and_verify_svn which depends on r29753
   which has not been backported to 1.5.x and hence test
   'merge_sensitive_log_target_with_bogus_mergeinfo' fails.

 * r30931
   Remove 'blind deletion of argument to mkdir --parents', delete
   only if this invocation has created it.
   Votes:
     +1: kameshj, hwright
   
 * r30937
   Rewrite svn_io_check_path's docstring and make it unambiguous.
   Justification:
     Ambiguous APIs are bad.
   Votes:
     +1: danielsh, kameshj

 * r30949, r30962
   Fix issue #3188.  Mergeinfo on switched targets/subtrees should elide
   to repos.
   Votes:
     +1: pburba (r30949 only)

 * r30963, r30964
   Improve the responsiveness and accuracy of 'svn log -g'.

     +1: cmpilato
