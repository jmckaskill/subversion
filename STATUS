Status of 1.4.0:
================

Candidate changes:

 * r19919
   Fix SVN_CONFIG_NICE to work with autoconf 2.60-dev CVS and prereleases,

   Justification:
     Developer convenience throughout the lifetime of 1.4.x.
     Note that affected versions are already packaged within Debian etch.
   Concerns:
     Adds a config.nice.old file that has no relevance to this fix.

    Votes:
      +1: lgo

  * r20030
    Fix svn export so it creates intermediate local folders if needed,

      Improves consistency for users.

      +1: rooneg
      +1: lgo, nori    (non-binding)

  * r20041
    Get rid of requirement for another RPM package (chrpath) to build the
    Linux RPM packages.
    Justification:
      Using Fedora Core as an example, I figured out a better
      way to simplify build package requirements with patch instead of
      package.

  * r20042
    Improve usability for Svn::Core::Dirent#time in the SWIG/Ruby bindings
    by converting its returned value from a Integer to a Time.

      Improves usability for the bindings.

  * r20077
    Fix merge failure when target of an add has been deleted.
    Justification:
      Simple fix, reported multiple times.

      +1: rooneg, nori
      +0: lgo

  * r20125
    ra_serf: Be more tolerant when updating a WC file without a delta base.
    Justification:
      Certain operations (switch) will cause a WC to invalidate the version-url
      parameter and causes ra_serf to crash on a subsequent update to that file.

      +1: jerenkrantz, rooneg

  * r20170
    Don't carry around our own Visual Studio project files for Apache/APR --
    they only worked for APR 0.9.x and the user can manually convert them.
    Justification:
      Low impact and needed for Apache 2.2 compatibility.
    Votes:
      +1: djh, rooneg

  * r20180, r20187
    Finish Apache 2.2/APR 1.x build/test support for Win32.
    Justification:
      Low impact and fixes some build and test issues with Win32 and
      Apache 2.2.

  * r20166
    Add install-swig-rb-doc make target.
    Justification:
      Improves usability for the bindings around documentation.
    Votes:
      +0: nori

  * r20248
    Improve usability of Svn::Core::Dirent in the SWIG/Ruby bindings
    by adding a method, Svn::Core::Dirent#have_props?.
    Justification:
      Adds only one alias and improves usability for the bindings.
    Note:
      Depends on r20225 - merge conflicts unless this revision is not merged.
    Votes:
      +1: nori

  * r20270
    Add 2 log commands required by loggy merge as added
    in r20313.
    Justification:
      Porting to 1.4.x prevents a wc-format bump later.
    Votes:
      +1: dionisos, rooneg

  * r20301, r20353
    Improve visibility of the "--version" option; fix quirks in parsing it.
    Justification:
      Users are happy if they can reasonably find a description for the
      "--version" option.
    Votes:
      +0: nori

  * r20340 (and r20313)
    Fix issue #1914: update runs diff3 twice
    Justification:
      With external diff3, without this chance, we can produce incorrect
      merge result reports (G instead of C) because internal and external
      diff tools can give different results.
    Note:
      r20340 depends on r20313 and 20270
    Votes:
      +1: dionisos, rooneg

Approved changes:

  * r20225
    Additional documentation for Ruby bindings
    Justification:
      Documentation is always good and the revision only adds docs.
    Note:
      Depends on r20042 - merge conflicts unless this revision is not merged.
