This file tracks the status of releases in the 1.5.x line.

See "Stabilizing and maintaining releases" in trunk/www/hacking.html for
details on how release lines and voting work, what kinds of bugs can
delay a release, etc.

Note: Because we anticipate a reasonable amount of new development
will still be required for Subversion 1.5, we are for the time being
applying the "somewhat looser voting system for areas that are not
core code" to the entire branch.

Status of 1.5.0:
================

Candidate changes:

 * r29434, r29436, r29438
   Copy-on-update can use loggy incorrectly, and possibly lead to dataloss
   Notes: although the issue #2986 summary doesn't say so, r29438
          actually fixed a dataloss bug (a file could end up with
          properties that no one had ever intended to put on it).
          r29434 and r29436 are just regression tests for r29438.

 * r29155
   Allow packagers to build some parts of svn against installed svn libs.

     +1: epg

 * r29268, r29269, r29287, r29389
   Fix 'log -g'.
   Notes: Performance improvements may follow, but merging this is better
     than nothing (as 'log -g' is currently and completely broken on 1.5.x).

 * r29379, r29401
   Support Neon 0.28.

     +1: pburba (r29401)

 * r29440
   With the advent of merge tracking, a reverse merge from a target's
   own history can no-op in some common use cases.  Prior to 1.5 these
   merges worked, so give a helpful warning that an update might be needed.

     -1: glasser [don't write to stderr from in a library]

 * r29412, r29414, r29415
   Change DAV 'SVN-ACTION' log names (which are already being changed
   incompatibly in 1.5) to mesh with svnserve command names, instead of
   making up yet another vocabulary to describe SVN operations.
   Votes:
     +1: glasser

 * r29418
   Avoid a hang when you SIGINT svnsync from a 1.4.x server over ra_svn
   (or in general, when one side has an error when receiving an edit
   but the other side finishes the command successfully before
   receiving the asynchronous error).

 * r29419
   Add an extra token to the revprops block in svnserve "replay-range"
   response.  Avoids a weird "malformed data" error in some cases (eg,
   SIGINTing an svnsync).
   Notes:
     Must be backported or reverted.
   Votes:
     +1: glasser

 * r29433
   Add more details to FSFS corruption errors.
   Notes:
     Not vital, but would be helpful for debugging any remaining
     corruption errors.
   Votes:
     +1: glasser

 * r29181, r29374
   A bunch of mergeinfo API changes (from the mergeinfo-api-cleanup
   branch).
   Notes:
     Must be backported or reverted.
     r29181 first is just a minor variable name change, but it's both
     more correct and prevents conflicts in the real change.
   Votes:
     +1: glasser

 * r29388
   Fix pool usage errors in mergeinfo code (WC corruption, segfaults, etc).
   Notes:
     Conflicts if applied before r29374 (also nominated).
   Votes:
     +1: glasser

 * r29382, r29397, r29417
   A few changes to use the mergeinfo-api-cleanup types.
   Notes:
     Depends on r29374.
   Votes:
     +1: glasser

 * r29288, r29348
   Fix issue #2996: Catch improper argument to diff against base revision.  
   This fixes a couple of potential aborts farther down the call stack.
   Justification:
     Aborting on invalid user input is Bad.
