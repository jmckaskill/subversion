Status of 1.7.6:

Candidate changes:
==================

 * r1293945, r1293972, r1293976, r1293998, r1294136, r1294236;
   r1294134, r1294147, r1294586
   Two interdependent changes:
   Fix issue #4121: copy followed by delete of unreadable child.
   Fix svn:// authz in Python tests.
   Justification:
     User resorted to patching the commit editor to work around this.
     Tests are broken.
   Notes:
     r1293945,r1293972,r1293976 are cosmetics.
     r1293998 is the fix.
     r1294136 is a test.
     r1294236 fixes an uninitialized variable.
   Notes:
     r1294134 extends a test to demonstrate its brokenness.
     r1294147 fixes said brokenness.
     r1294586 fixes r1294147 for Windows.

 * r1307177
   Move mod_dontdothat to install-tools.
   Justification:
     Undo compatibility break of 'make install' in 1.7.3.
   Votes:
     +1: danielsh, gstein

 * r1337441
   Fix XML namespace expansion in ra_serf
   Justification:
     Avoids segfaults caused by a malicious server sending unknown prefixes
     to ra_serf. (and corrects the semantics for a bonus win)
   Votes:
     +1: gstein, rhuijben

 * r1338810, r1339164
   Fix issue #4184 ("partial svnsync drops properties when converting
   copies to adds").
   Justification:
     Syncs that don't aren't synced at all.
   Notes:
     r1338810 taught the code to send properties for demoted copies.
     r1339164 fixed a theoretical use of uninitialized memory.
   Votes:
     +1: cmpilato
     +1: rhuijben (r1338810 only)

 * r1306275, and too many other revisions to list here
   New diff support code for added/deleted files and directories.
   Fixes issue #4153, "svn log --diff" on moved file gives "not found",
   and other problems.
   Justification:
     The current code (introduced in 1.7.x in the r1207351 backport commit)
     produces inconsistent paths in diff output (see
     http://svn.haxx.se/dev/archive-2012-03/0385.shtml), and it also breaks
     with the paradigm that the target of an editor drive may never have more
     than one path component (which according to cmpilato is an API violation).
   Notes:
     Please read the branch and related trunk log messages for detailed notes
     about these changes.
   Branch:
     ^/subversion/branches/1.7.x-issue4153  
   Votes:
     +1: stsp
   
 * ^/subversion/branches/1.7.x-performance
   Use the working copy status walker as a first filter to find committable
   nodes.
   Justification:
     Huge performance boost. Especially on NFS.
   Notes:
     Backports the status walker framework. Many other parts are backportable
     too, but this branch delivers the plumbing.
   Votes:
     +0: rhuijben (I would like to see some test results before backporting)

 * r1341012, r1341076
   Sort 'svn status' output to avoid randomness in output with APR-1.4.6.
   Justification:
     Sorted output is nicer for users. Some users even perceive random output
     order with APR-1.4.6 as a regression.

 * 1341031
   Sort output of 'svn proplist' to avoid randomness with APR-1.4.6
   Justification:
     Sorted output is nicer for users. Some users even perceive random output
     order with APR-1.4.6 as a regression.
   Votes:
     +1: stsp, gstein

 * r1341034
   Sort output of 'svn propget -R' to avoid randomness with APR-1.4.6
   Justification:
     Sorted output is nicer for users. Some users even perceive random output
     order with APR-1.4.6 as a regression.
   Votes:
     +1: stsp, gstein

 * r1348822, r1349215
   Fix "svn status -u --depth empty FILE"
   Justification:
     Modified file not shown as modified by above command.
     Simple fix, test included.
   Branch: https://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/subversion/branches/1.7.x-r1348822
   Votes:
     +1: stsp, gstein

 * r1349778
   For issue #3962, fix example output of 'svn status' shown in 'svn
   help status'.
   Justification:
     OCD.
   Votes:
     +1: cmpilato, gstein

Veto-blocked changes:
=====================

Approved changes:
=================

 * r1349367, r1349371, r1349380
   Fix a bug in ra_serf that prevented it working against pre-1.2 servers.
   Justification:
     Violation of our compatibility promise.
   Votes:
     +1: cmpilato, hwright, gstein

 * r1346765
   Allow file://C:\users\me/repos style paths as argument to svn, svnadmin and
   svnsync on Windows, like we did in 1.6. (file://%CD%/repos is nice in test
   scripts)
   Justification:
     Small regression. Easy to fix in the option parser. Fixes a privately
     reported user issue
     svnsync: Session is rooted at 'file:///C:%5CUsers%5Cme/repos/
     C:%5CUsers%5Cme/repos' but the repos root is 'file:///C:%5CUsers%5Cme/repos'
   Votes:
     +1: rhuijben, stsp, gstein

 * r1342984
   Avoid a full table scan on every directory during 'svn upgrade'
   Justification:
     Makes svn upgrade unnecessary slow. Trivial fix.
   Votes:
     +1: rhuijben, steveking, gstein

 * r1340556
   Avoid a stat per working copy find operation by statting .svn instead of two
   nodes inside .svn, per wc-directory that doesn't have a .svn directory.
   Justification:
     Very simple fix that gives the working copy find code a huge performance
     boost.
