details on how release lines and voting work, what kinds of bugs can
delay a release, etc.

Status of 1.4.0:
================

Candidate changes:

  * r20781
    autogen.sh: Purge *.pyc files from the build/ hierarchy after using the
    build generator, so that we do not ship them in tarballs.
    Justification:
      Shipping detritus like .pyc files in release tarballs is sloppy.
    Votes:
      +1: maxb
      -1: cmpilato (this is a very odd place to do this.  dist.sh, perhaps?)

  * r20190, r20250, r20444, r20826
    A few improvements to the Windows build system including a fix for the
    swig perl bindings.  They are grouped together to avoid conflicts.
    Justification:
      Most are very low impact build improvements, but without r20826 the
      Perl bindings won't build on Windows.
    Votes:
      +1: djh, brane (r20826 only from email),
          pburba (r20190, r20444, r20826)
      +0: dlr, pburba (r20250)

  * r20172, r20828
    Update the Windows build instructions.
    Justification:
      Documentation that more closely matches the reality is good.
    Votes:
      +1: djh, dlr

  * r20833, r20836 (depends on r20190 group above)
    Provide named, separate debug information files for clients building
    against Subversion libraries.
    Justification:
      Very low impact and silences hundreds of warnings about missing debug
      information when linking to Subversion libraries.
    Votes:
      +1: djh
      +0: dlr, cmpilato

  * r20834, r20864
    Fix issue #2583: 'svn diff' shouldn't require write access
    to the working copy.
    Justification:
      Low impact change restoring previous behavior.
    Votes:
      +1: dionisos, dlr

  * r20883
    Fix an l10n encoding error for an error message from svn.
    Justification:
      Inability to display a correct error message due to an encoding issue
      is not good and confuses users using locales with many multibyte
      characters.  The change has low impact.
    Votes:
      +1: nori

  * r20885
    Clarify an error message.
    Justification:
      A low-risk error message improvement.
    Votes:
      +1: nori, dlr
    
  * r20886 (depends on r20833 group above)
    Allow javahl to build with VC Express and fix its debug symbol files.
    Justification:
      Low impact and allows javahl to build on VC Express.
    Votes:
      +1: djh
