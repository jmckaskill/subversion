This file tracks the status of releases in the 1.4.x line.

See "Stabilizing and maintaining releases" in trunk/www/hacking.html for
details on how release lines and voting work, what kinds of bugs can
delay a release, etc.

Status of 1.4.0:
================

Candidate changes:

  * r20781
    autogen.sh: Purge *.pyc files from the build/ hierarchy after using the
    build generator, so that we do not ship them in tarballs.
    Justification:
      Shipping detritus like .pyc files in release tarballs is sloppy.

  * r20190, r20250, r20444, r20826
    A few improvements to the Windows build system including a fix for the
    swig perl bindings.  They are grouped together to avoid conflicts.
    Justification:
      Most are very low impact build improvements, but without r20826 the
      Perl bindings won't build on Windows.

      +0: dlr

  * r20172, r20828
    Update the Windows build instructions.
    Justification:
      Documentation that more closely matches the reality is good.

      +1: djh, dlr

  * r20833, r20836 (depends on r20190 group above)
    Provide named, separate debug information files for clients building
    against Subversion libraries.
    Justification:
      Very low impact and silences hundreds of warnings about missing debug
      information when linking to Subversion libraries.

Status of 1.4.1:
================

Candidate changes:

  * r20384
    Fix issue #2583: 'svn diff' shouldn't require write access
    to the working copy.
    Justification:
      Relatively low impact change; most of it is copy-pasted from
      old (proven) code.
    Notes:
      translated_file_for_diff() was kept as close as can be expected
      to its originator (svn_wc_translated_file2), to make the change
      where both are merged as trivial as can be.
