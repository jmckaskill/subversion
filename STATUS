This file tracks the status of releases in the 1.6.x line.

See "Stabilizing and maintaining releases" in trunk/www/hacking.html for
details on how release lines and voting work, what kinds of bugs can
delay a release, etc.

Status of 1.6.3:
================

Candidate changes:

 * r37478, r37543, r37544, r37545, r37547
   Support using `svnversion` on files and improve some messages printed by
   `svnversion`.
   Justification:
     Some messages printed by `svnversion` are inconsistent and sometimes
     incorrect:
     $ svnversion /usr
     exported
     $ svnversion /bin/ls
     '/bin/ls' not versioned, and not exported
     $ svnversion VERSIONED_FILE
     'VERSIONED_FILE' not versioned, and not exported
     $ svnversion /nonexistent
     subversion/libsvn_wc/questions.c:90: (apr_err=2)
     svn: '/nonexistent' does not exist
     ^^^
     Messages with these revisions backported:
     $ svnversion /usr
     Unversioned directory
     $ svnversion /bin/ls
     Unversioned file
     $ svnversion VERSIONED_FILE
     NUMBER
     $ svnversion /nonexistent
     '/nonexistent' doesn't exist

 * r37491, r37593, r37618
   Another merge performance improvement: Reduce contacts with server when
   a subtree with mergeinfo has non-inheritable mergeinfo and the subtree's
   immediate children have no explicit mergeinfo.
   Justification:
     If you hit this use case and the and the subtree in question has a *lot*
     of immediate children without mergeinfo then this change will avoid
     needless round trips for *each* of those children.
   Notes:
     There is a call to svn_uri_basename() in
     inherit_implicit_mereginfo_form_parent() that must be changed to
     svn_path_basename() since the former is new for 1.7.
     r37491 is the fix, r37593 is a typo fix, r37618 is some code refactoring
     to address gstein's bloat concern.

     -0: gstein (code bloat)

 * r37622
   Work around a buffer overflow bug in some APR versions (recently
   fixed) by (ultimately) using apr_brigade_write() instead of
   apr_brigade_vprintf() to transmit large chunks of base64-encoded
   property data.
   Branch:
     ^/branches/1.6.x-r37622
   Justification:
     Failure case comes as a surprise, and basically blocks svnsync from
     moving on past a troublesome revision.  Upgrading APR to a fixed
     version is good, but not necessarily an option.  Our workaround is
     easier to deploy.
   Notes:
     Because of some refactoring work done on trunk, this isn't so
     much a backport as a reimplementation.  But merging the branch
     should do the trick.
   Votes:
     +1: cmpilato

 * r37627
   Fix for issue #3126 'svn mergeinfo shows too few or too many eligible
   revisions'
   Branch:
     ^/branches/1.6.x-r37627
   Justification:
     Without this change the svn mergeinfo subcommand gives incorrect
     and inconsistent results when encountering non-inheritable mergeinfo.
     See http://subversion.tigris.org/issues/show_bug.cgi?id=3126#desc5.
   Notes:
     r37627 revved the svn_mergeinfo_remove and svn_mergeinfo_intersect
     APIS.  So I created a backport branch that moves the declaration for
     these to subversion/include/private/svn_mergeinfo_private.h.

 * r37827
   If the configure script check for bindtextdomain() in libintl fails,
   try again with -liconv.
   Justification:
     Fixes NLS support detection at least on OpenBSD, and maybe more systems.
   Notes:
     I patched this bug ages ago for the OpenBSD Subversion package
     but never committed a fix for it here (my bad). Solaris may also
     be affected, I am waiting for feedback from a user about this.
