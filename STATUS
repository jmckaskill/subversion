Status of 1.2.1:
================

Candidate changes:

  * r14774, r14849, r14851, r14862, r14893, r14898, r14905, r14947
    Fix locking bug when working on a switched file in the wc and
    a bug when locking an URL with URL-encoded characters in the path.
    Justification:
      Old behavior caused the wrong file to be locked and locking of URLs
      with spaces and non-ASCII characters to not work.
    Notes: 
      14774 is the commit of the test, 14849 is the fix, the rest are 
      refinements.
      Without r14898, this introduces a regression on locking paths
      with "funny" characters.
      Use 1.2.x-r14774 branch.

  * r14885
    Python bindings, fix for functions returning MD5 digests.
    Justification:
      Small change, potentially useful, 1.3 is quite some way off.
    Votes:
      +1: maxb, dlr
      
  * r15046
    Fix incorrect modification of request_rec->content_type.
    Justification:
      Corrects API violation, allowing the AddOutputFilterByType
      directive to function properly.
    Votes:
      +1: dlr, kfogel

  * r15088
    Make lock/unlock over ra_dav able to cache authentication data.
