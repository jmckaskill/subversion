This file tracks the status of releases in the 1.4.x line.

See "Stabilizing and maintaining releases" in trunk/www/hacking.html for
details on how release lines and voting work, what kinds of bugs can
delay a release, etc.

NOTE:  This branch uses svnmerge.py for merge tracking.  Please familiarize
yourself with that tool if you plan to actually merge changes here.

For example, to merge a number of revisions from trunk into branch,
you can use the svnmerge.py script that is in the branch.

$ contrib/client-side/svnmerge.py merge -r 21000-21006,21008,21876
$ svn diff
$ svn commit

Do not run svnmerge.py N separate times for each revision to merge
over, since svnmerge.py will not merge into a WC with uncommitted
changes.

Status of 1.4.3:
================

Candidate changes:

  * r19842
    Synchronize (and improve readability of ) the various instances of our 
    license text + upgrade to 2006.
    Justification:
     Preparing to release 1.4.2 windows installer, license now on 1.4 branch
     is now difficult to read. Actual license text isn't changed.

     +1: lgo

  * r21516, r22155, r22224
    Fixes for the Windows installer script: add license files of the
    libraries, typos and copyright year.
    Justification:
     Preparing to release 1.4.2 windows installer.

  * r21531, r21848, r21934
    Allow HTTP auth protocols to be configurable by way of a
    "http-auth-types" parameter.
    Justification:
      Allow GSSAPI/SSPI auth to be enabled/disabled on Windows with
      Neon 0.26.1+, addressesing numerous bug reports from
      TortoiseSVN, Subversion, Subclipse, etc.

      -1: cmpilato (new features showing up in patch releases?  nuh-uh.)

  * r21885, r22076
    Add a new RPM package for the AuroraLinux 2.0 SPARC distribution.
    Justification:
      It is a combination of RHEL3 and RHEL4 distributions with
      characteristics matching both, so we need a new directory.
    Branch: 1.4.x-r22076 (-r22079:HEAD)
    Votes:
      +1: dws
      -1: maxb (It appears that the auroralinux-2 directory has been based
                on an old version of the rhel-3 directory, pre-dating some
                of the difference-reduction work I did to try to minimize the
                unnecessary inconsistencies between the various distro
                flavours. Its introduction therefore represents a regression
                in the maintainability of the RPM packaging area as a whole.)

  * r22205, r22207, r22214
    subversion/tests/cmdline/davautocheck.sh improvements:
      Fallback to curl if wget is not available.
      Unset all proxy environmental variables for curl and wget.
    Justification:
      Nice for davautocheck.sh to work if:
        People are behind a firewall with PROXY set, or
        If they only have curl and not wget.

  * r22253
    svn-graph.pl: Update invocation of $ra->get_log() to account for
    the Perl API's $limit parameter.
    Justification:
      Failure to pass this parameter is incorrect API usage, and
      results in a broken script.
    Votes:
      +1: dlr

Approved changes:

  * r22203
    Allow svn_load_dirs.pl to work with filenames containing @
      characters.
    Justification:
      Simple fix for a contrib tool.
