This file tracks the status of releases in the 1.7.x line.

See http://subversion.apache.org/docs/community-guide/releasing.html#release-stabilization
for details on how release lines and voting work, what kinds of bugs can
delay a release, etc.

Status of 1.7.0:

Candidate changes:
==================

 * r1146131 and followups
   Add svn_fs_verify() and implement rep-cache verification in FSFS using it.
   Branch:
     1.7.x-fs-verify
   Justification:
     Would be nice to extend verify already in 1.7.x.
   Notes:
     This does not include progress reporting, since that is nominated
     separately.
   Votes:
     +1: rhuijben (only for 1.7.0)
     +0: danielsh
     +0: gstein (progress would be nice)

 * fs-progress branch
   Notes:
     Depends on the r1146131 group (1.7.x-fs-verify).
   Branch:
     fs-progress
   Justification:
     Provide feedback during 'svnadmin verify'.
     Avoid an API change in 1.8.
   Notes:
     If this proposal passes, the docstrings @since would have to be fixed
     in a new commit.
   Votes:
     +1: rhuijben (only for 1.7.0)
     +0: danielsh

 * r1147540, r1147541
   Remove unused variables in build system.
   Justification:
     Backporting of future changes will be easier.
   Votes:
     +1: arfrever
     -0: stsp (we can backport these when we need to)

 * r1154278, r1154379, r1154382
   Make 'svn ls' capable of listing Subversion 1.0-1.3 repositories using
   ra_serf.
   Justification:
     We promised not to break backwards compatibility and it is not nice
     that serf doesn't want to list the neon repository.
     (Check svn ls http://svn.webdav.org/repos/projects/neon/)
   Notes:
     r1154278 is a quick hack to detect old servers and to at least return
              some information.
     r1154379 is the real fix: fallback to a more compatible request.
     r1154382 makes sure the right result is used directly after falling
              back from svn_ra_serf__get_dir.
              (Most likely the problem is detected earlier than this function)
   Votes:
     +1: rhuijben

 * r1158187, r1158196, r1158201, r1158207
   Fix issues #2557 and #3987: 'svn info symlink/to/wc'.
   Justification:
     That syntax should work.
   Notes:
     Depends on the r1158193 group.
   Votes:
     +1: danielsh (without r1158187)
     +1: rhuijben, cmpilato

 * r1158616
   Recreate missing directories on file install errors.
   Justification:
     Trivial patch that fixes a variable reference in a patch that should have
     handled a common user problem. The result is improved the svn cleanup
     stability.
   Votes:
     +1: rhuijben, cmpilato

  * r1158617, r1158875, r1158886, r1158896, r1158919, r1158924, r1158963
    Make 'svn revert' remove unversioned nodes resulting from reverting a copy.
    Fixes issue #3101.
    Justification:
      Bert suggested to backport this to 1.7.
      I myself am not really sure if we should consider this a bug fix
      or a behaviour change. I think we should merge this before 1.7.0
      if we decide to merge it.
      It does fix some fairly annoying usability issues.
      For instance: If a merge adds files, the merge result is reverted, and
      the merge is repeated, the second merge does not produce the same result
      as the first merge. It will skip the, now unversioned, files added by
      the first merge. There are various other cases where the unversioned
      files get in the way.
    Notes:
      All revisions depend on one another, but some amend or even undo changes
      made in earlier revisions. Instead of reviewing the individual commits
      I would suggest to run the following merge and review the resulting diff:
        svn merge -c1158617,1158875,1158886,1158896,1158919,1158924,1158963 \
          ^/subversion/trunk
    Votes:
      +1: stsp, rhuijben (but only if this gets into 1.7.0)

 * r1159132, r1159136, r1159148
   Make serf provide a sensible path for out of date items with HTTPv1 servers.
   Justifications:
     Bad errors are bad.
   Notes:
     r1159132 is a nonfunctional rename to make the code clearer. 
     r1159136 is the real fix.
     r1159148 is a further cleanup (Not required, but makes patching easier)
   Votes:
     +1: rhuijben
   
Veto-blocked changes:
=====================

 * r1148992
   Print error messages about failures of dynamic loading of libraries when
   SVN_DEBUG_DSO is defined instead of never.
   Justification:
     Suboptimal r1148374 was already backported in r1148488.
   Votes:
     +1: arfrever
     -1: rhuijben (A library shouldn't just write things to stderr. This needs
                   proper error handling instead. And besides I doubt anyone is
                   going to use this define (Soft veto. Feel free to -0 when the
                   problems are resolved))
     -0: philip (changed my mind, I don't think this is needed on the branch)
     -0: stsp (Arfrever, can you please explain precisely what use case you
               have for this code? Why do you need it in the release, or
               on trunk, for that matter?)


Approved changes:
=================

 * r1158196, r1158201, r1158207, r1158209, r1158210, r1158217
   Fix another variant of issues #2557 and #3987: 'svnversion symlink/to/wc'.
   Justification:
     That syntax should work.
   Notes:
     r1158196, r1158201, r1158207 adds (and tweaks) the test for tis problem.
   Votes:
     +1: rhuijben, danielsh, cmpilato

 * r1158407, r1158419, r1158854
   Fix issue #3989 'merge which deletes file with native eol-style raises
     spurious tree conflict'.
   Justification:
     Fixes a regression from 1.6.x in a common merge use case.
   Notes:
     r1158407 and r1158419 are the test, r1158854 is the fix.
   Votes:
     +1: pburba, cmpilato
     +1: rhuijben (patch is ok, but I think libsvn_wc should provide some
                   support instead of some reimplementation in libsvn_client)

 * r1158893
   Make sure that serf doesn't insert a final '\0' in a property value
   retrieved via svn_ra_get_file_revs().
   Justification:
     Unbreaks annotate in AnkhSVN when using serf. (See log message for
     details). svn's blame receiver doesn't notice any problems as it just
     assumes that the interesting property values are valid cstrings.
   Votes:
     +1: rhuijben, hwright, cmpilato

 * r1159093
   Use a macro in wc-queries.sql.
   Justification:
     Source code readability.  Avoid conflicts in future backports.
   Branch:
     1.7.x-r1159093
   Votes:
     +1: danielsh, rhuijben, cmpilato
     -0: stsp (we can backport this when we need to)
