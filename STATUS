This file tracks the status of releases in the 1.7.x line.

See http://subversion.apache.org/docs/community-guide/releasing.html#release-stabilization
for details on how release lines and voting work, what kinds of bugs can
delay a release, etc.

Status of 1.7.0:

Candidate changes:
==================

 * r1146131 and followups
   Add svn_fs_verify() and implement rep-cache verification in FSFS using it.
   Branch:
     1.7.x-fs-verify
   Justification:
     Would be nice to extend verify already in 1.7.x.
   Notes:
     This does not include progress reporting; that has been postponed to 1.8.
   Conflicts:
     On fs_fs.c.  Resolve with 'theirs-conflict'.
   Votes:
     +1: danielsh, rhuijben
     +0: gstein (progress would be nice) (without r1161164, r1161180)
     -0: cmpilato (For a function with this name, the implementation is far
         too anemic. I'd prefer this be a private function in 1.7.x, leaving
         room for a future public API that really does full verification.)
         (without r1161164, r1161180)

 * r1147540, r1147541
   Remove unused variables in build system.
   Justification:
     Backporting of future changes will be easier.
   Votes:
     +1: arfrever
     -0: stsp (we can backport these when we need to)
     -0: gstein

 * r1154278, r1154379, r1154382
   Make 'svn ls' capable of listing Subversion 1.0-1.3 repositories using
   ra_serf.
   Justification:
     We promised not to break backwards compatibility and it is not nice
     that serf doesn't want to list the neon repository.
     (Check svn ls http://svn.webdav.org/repos/projects/neon/)
   Notes:
     r1154278 is a quick hack to detect old servers and to at least return
              some information.
     r1154379 is the real fix: fallback to a more compatible request.
     r1154382 makes sure the right result is used directly after falling
              back from svn_ra_serf__get_dir.
              (Most likely the problem is detected earlier than this function)
   Votes:
     +1: rhuijben, cmpilato

 * r1163243, r1163383
   Fix issue #3791 'svn mergeinfo shows natural history of added subtrees
   as eligible'.
   Justification:
     The 'svn mergeinfo [ -R | --depth [ files | immediates | infinity ] ]'
     subcommand gives incorrect answers in some use cases.
   Notes:
     r1163243 is a test for the issue, r1163383 is the fix.
   Votes:
     +1: pburba

 * r1164386
   Avoid an expensive database operation in 'svn info'.
   Justification:
     Improves performance of 'svn info' on a single unmodified node by 20-30%, by
     moving an in most cases unneeded database call in the error handling.
   Votes:
     +1: rhuijben, hwright
     +1: gstein (for 1.7.1)

 * r1164426, r1164614
   Fix STMT_SELECT_NODE_CHILDREN_WALKER_INFO for correctness and speed.
   Justification:
     Recursive info and propset don't scale well with large working copies
     and may possibly act on the wrong nodes.
     On a Linux machine with a Subversion trunk working copy on a local disk
     running 'svn info --depth infinity' shows it to be 2 or 3 times faster.
     On a larger working copy it's orders of magnitude faster.
   Votes:
     +1: philip
     +0: peters, gstein (looks correct, but I didn't test, and while
                         performance should be better, I wonder if that's
                         been tested at all)

 * r1167659
   Don't sort an already sorted array in svn_sort__hash().
   Justification:
     Possible performance improvement for merges, and doesn't cost anything.
     This function is used to sort mergeinfo catalogs, among other things.
   Votes:
     +1: stsp, rhuijben (for 1.7.1), pburba

 * r1173425, r1173639
   Fix issue #4013 'merge performance regression in 1.7 when target has no
   explicit mergeinfo' by reverting the fixes for issue #3669 'inheritance 
   an result in mergeinfo describing nonexistent sources'.
   Justification:
     The issue #3669 fixes reverted in r1173425 imposed an unacceptable
     performance penalty on the server.  A new approach is needed, but can
     wait till 1.8.
   Branch:
     ^/subversion/branches/1.7.x-r1173425
   Notes:
     Issue #3668 'inheritance can result in self-referential mergeinfo' is
     also reverted as part of this change, see
     http://subversion.tigris.org/issues/show_bug.cgi?id=3668#desc5
     r1173425 is the reversion of the issue #3669 fixes including all the
     API changes.  r1173639 is the reversion of r1036078, which was a
     follow-up to the issue #3669 fixes that didn't get fully removed
     in r1173425.
   Notes:
     This may be missing a hunk?  See "Subject: Does this need to be added to
     the #3668/#3669 revert?" on dev@.  --danielsh
   Votes:
     +1: pburba, philip
     +0: ivan (r1173425 only, restart soak period for at least two weeks due
               API and client/server protocol)
     +0: danielsh (I didn't review merge_tests.py.
                   All changes in merge.c look good, but I can't tell if
                   additional changes that should have been included are 
                   missing, so not upgrading the vote to +1.)

 * r1174111
   Use the correct function to copy repositories in the testsuite.
   Justification:
     Prevent occassional test failure.
   Notes:
     Merge conflict on externals_tests.py resolved with --accept mf.
   Votes:
     +1: philip
     +0: pburba (Ideally this would be done as a subtree merge targeting
                 basic_tests.py, as danielsh points out in
                 http://svn.haxx.se/dev/archive-2011-09/0482.shtml.  I'm +1
                 if the backport is done that way).
     +1: danielsh (conditioned upon the backport done as per Paul's comment)

 * r1174761
   Better error message when configuring --without-zlib.
   Votes:
     +1: danielsh
