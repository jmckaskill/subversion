Status of 1.1.2:
================

Candidate changes:

  * r11483 (Issue #2091)
    Unitialized variable on Win98.
    Justification:
      It was causing random failures for our Win98 users.  The fix
      also correctly sets the locale path now, making locale stuff
      work as well.
    Notes: Change looks good to me.  I can't in good conscience +1
      it only because I don't have the environment to test nor the
      docs to review the MultiByteToWideChar() call.  -kfogel

  * r11439, r11669
    Fix slow "svn st" where the targets are files by not locking the whole
    anchor tree.
    Votes:
      +1: lundblad, dionisos
      (r11439 nominated by): Steve King

  * r11665
    Make FSFS commits work with insert-only perms on db/revs.
    Justification:
      This is a pretty straightforward order-of-operations change, is
      how I (Greg) always intended FSFS to work, and fulfills what has
      been a secondary goal of FSFS from the beginning.

  * Issue #2111

  * r11047 (Issue #2032)
    Always call mkdir-init, even if we're not in a VPATH setup.
    Justification:
      Allows users to install JavaHL without manually creating
      directories to work around Issue #2032.
    Votes:
      Nominated by: David James <james82@gmail.com>

  * r11050
    Add install dependencies for libsvn_fs and libsvn_fs_base.
    Justification:
      Allows users to install JavaHL separately, without needing to
      compile and install the base subversion package.  Without this
      fix, JavaHL installation crashes in that case.

  * r11685
    Internationalization issues for the Windows Installer
    Justification:
      Keeping the installer in sync with actual 1.1.x Windows build.
      The Apache Server will not run on some systems w/o this merge.

  * r11451, r11630
    Fix pool usage and stalled object reference counts in Perl bindings.
    Justification:
      Reduce memory leaks in Perl bindings.
    Votes:
      +1: clkao, epg

  * r11708
    Fix a bug which caused certain unfinished switch operations to leave
    the working copy in a busticated state.
    Justification:
      Did you miss the part where I said "working copy ... busticated state"?

  * r11730, r11743 (Issue #2108)
    Fix UNC paths on Cygwin.
    Justification:
      Regression from 1.0.x

      +1: brane, lundblad

  * r11740
    Fix encoding bug in svn ls -v.
    Justification:
      Encoding bugs look ugly, especially in Asian languages.  Simple fix.

  * r11797
    Reset messages locale back to "C" in svnserve.
    Justification:
      We shouldn't send translated errors over the svn protocol.
    Note:
      This conflicts, since r11783 is not going to be merged.  I'd say
      it's too trivial to create a branch forit.

  * r11862, r11921 (part of issue #1997)
    Fix encoding bug in svnserve -h.
