This file tracks the status of releases in the 1.0.x line.

See "Stabilizing and maintaining releases" in trunk/HACKING for
details on how release lines and voting work, what kinds of bugs can
delay a release, etc.

Status of 1.0.1:
================

1.0.1 is currently scheduled for Friday, 12 March 2004.  A thought: it
would be nice if all changes could be *committed* by the beginning of
Wednesday, March 10th (er, UTC), so we have a period in which there's
something stable to test.

    Add an example wrapper to help svn+ssh users using setgid svnserve.
    Votes:
      +1: epg, sussman
      +0: dionisos

  * r8867, r8868, r8902
    Trivial performance fix for mod_authz_svn; cache the access file per
    connection instead of reloading it per request.
    Justification: Saves at least 2 loads of the access file per update, plus
    an additional number of times equal to the number of entries in the REPORT
    response.
    Notes: Similar code has been present in mod_dav_svn to cache an open
    filesystem per connection.
    Votes:
      +1: striker
      -0: kfogel  (Reviewed the change; it's not *so* trivial, and I'm
                   not sure an optimization like this belongs in a
                   patch release.)

  * r8959
    Correct a switch bug that caused the wrong URL to be left in the working
    copy when the switch was interrupted.
    Justification: simple fix; very annoying when WC gets messed up.
    Votes:
       +1: julianfoad

  * r8962
    Followup to r8842 ('svn st -v' shows unwanted status of externals).
    Justification:  we've already merged 8842, this is a followup fix.

      +1: cmpilato
