Status of 1.7.2:

Candidate changes:
==================

 * r1147540, r1147541
   Remove unused variables in build system.
   Justification:
     Backporting of future changes will be easier.
   Votes:
     +1: arfrever
     -0: stsp (we can backport these when we need to)
     -0: gstein

 * r1188652, r1188677, r1188762
   Fix issue 4042, commit incomplete directory asserts.
   Justification:
     Regression from 1.6.
   Votes:
     +1: philip
     +0: rhuijben (Patch appears ok. Will bump to +1 after further review)

 * r1188774, 1197135
   Fix issue #4044, "empty parents of externals not removed along with
   externals on update".
   Justification:
     Currently empty unversioned directories are left behind, possibly
     obstructing future updates which re-add the directory.
   Votes:
     +1: stsp, rhuijben

 * r1201824
   Fix issue #2873.
   Justification:
     svn diff -c N on a file added in revision N is broken.
     Not a regression from 1.6.x but backporting this fix is easy
     because it needs no public API changes.
   Branch:
     ^/subversion/branches/1.7.x-r1201824
   Votes:
     +1: stsp, rhuijben

 * r1204610, r1204673
   Log error chain, rather than generic error, when opening rep-cache.db fails.
   Justification:
      Makes the real cause visible to the apache admin.
   Votes:
     +1: philip, danielsh

 * r1205193
   Fix 'svn import' with svn:eol-style 'native' and inconsistent EOLs.
   Justification:
     'svn import' with auto-props setting 'svn:eol-style' to 'native'
     requires workarounds for files with inconsistent EOLs, while it
     just works for fixed values like 'LF' or 'CRLF'. Mailing list discussion
     at http://svn.haxx.se/dev/archive-2011-02/0767.shtml didn't find any
     reason for this inconsistency. Also fixes up a poor error message.
     Problem reported by user in #svn, see
     http://colabti.org/irclogger/irclogger_log/svn?date=2011-11-22#l152 and
     http://colabti.org/irclogger/irclogger_log/svn?date=2011-11-22#l203
   Votes:
     +1: stsp

 * r1201072, r1205188, r1205209     
   Fix issue #4050 "'svn mergeinfo' always considers non-inheritable ranges
   as partially merged".
   Justification:
     'svn mergeinfo' gave incorrect answers in what is admittedly an edge
     case, but the fix is very simple.
   Notes:
     r1201072 and r1205188 are a new test and minor tweak respectively.
     r1205209 is the fix.
   Votes:
     +1: pburba

 * r1205726
   Plug a memory leak in the fs-base deltification logic which has
   been observed to exhaust all the available memory on a server on a
   real-world dataset.
   Justification:
     Can you say DoS?
   Votes:
     +1: cmpilato

 * r1205839, r1205848
   Fix reading beyond end of a (not null-terminated) string in BDB lock code.
   Justification:
     Undefined behaviour. http://svn.haxx.se/dev/archive-2011-11/0350.shtml
   Votes:
     +1: philip
   
Veto-blocked changes:
=====================

 * r1146131 and followups
   Add svn_fs_verify() and implement rep-cache verification in FSFS using it.
   Branch:
     1.7.x-fs-verify
   Justification:
     Would be nice to extend verify already in 1.7.x.
   Notes:
     This does not include progress reporting; that has been postponed to 1.8.
   Conflicts:
     On fs_fs.c.  Resolve with 'theirs-conflict'.
   Votes:
     +1: danielsh, rhuijben
     +0: gstein (progress would be nice) (without r1161164, r1161180)
     -0: cmpilato (For a function with this name, the implementation is far
         too anemic. I'd prefer this be a private function in 1.7.x, leaving
         room for a future public API that really does full verification.)
         (without r1161164, r1161180)
     -1: danielsh (invasive, new feature)

Approved changes:
=================
