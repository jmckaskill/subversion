This file tracks the status of releases in the 1.5.x line.

See "Stabilizing and maintaining releases" in trunk/www/hacking.html for
details on how release lines and voting work, what kinds of bugs can
delay a release, etc.

Status of 1.5.0:
================

Candidate changes:

 * r30746, r30747
   Fix a minor merge range notification header bug.
   Notes:
     r30747 is just cleanup of some cruft that snuck in with r30746,
     thus adhering to my "every commit should need a follow-up" ethos.

 * r30949, r30962
   Fix issue #3188.  Mergeinfo on switched targets/subtrees should elide
   to repos.
   Votes:
     +1: pburba, markphip

 * r29191, r29398, r29833, r30663, r30963, r30964
   Improve the responsiveness and accuracy of 'svn log -g'.
   Backport branch: 
     r30963-1.5.x
   Notes:
     r29191, and r29398 are super-trivial "obvious" tweaks.
     r29833 and r30663 are code formatting changes.
     These aren't strictly required, but vastly improve the merge of
     the workhorse commits.  (And bring subversion/libsvn_repos/log.c
     completely up to date with trunk.)
   Votes:
     +1: cmpilato
     +0: markphip (r30963-64 only; +1, but revs don't merge clean)

 * r30986
   Fix potential segfault in svn_io_remove_dir2(path='.').
   Votes:
     +1: danielsh, stsp

Status of 1.5.1:
================

Candidate changes:

Approved changes (all releases):
================================

 * Remove exit_code from the return tuple of the function call
   to svntest.actions.run_and_verify_svn which depends on r29753
   which has not been backported to 1.5.x and hence test
   'merge_sensitive_log_target_with_bogus_mergeinfo' fails.
