This file tracks the status of releases in the 1.0.x line.

See "Stabilizing and maintaining releases" in trunk/HACKING for
details on how release lines and voting work, what kinds of bugs can
delay a release, etc.

Status of 1.0.2:
================

Candidate changes:

  * r8846
    Add an example wrapper to help svn+ssh users using setgid svnserve.
    Votes:
      +1: epg, sussman
      +0: dionisos

  * r8867, r8868, r8902
    Trivial performance fix for mod_authz_svn; cache the access file per
    connection instead of reloading it per request.
    Justification: Saves at least 2 loads of the access file per update, plus
    an additional number of times equal to the number of entries in the REPORT
    response.
    Notes: Similar code has been present in mod_dav_svn to cache an open
    filesystem per connection.

      +1: striker
      -0: kfogel  (Reviewed the change; it's not *so* trivial, and I'm
                   not sure an optimization like this belongs in a
                   patch release.)

  * r9003
    Include the path to the directory containing libsvn_swig_java in
    SWIG_JAVA_LINK to allow the SWIG Java bindings to actually build.
    Justification: It is not possible to build the SWIG Java bindings
    without this fix.
    Votes:
      +1: dlr
      +1: breser

  * r9212, r9231
    Added VC7 support and defines for including debug symbol files.
    Justification: The setup in 1.0.x branch is useless if VC7 is used
    Notes:  The 1.0.1 zip file content was build with VC7 and the Windows
            installer for 1.0.1 had to be set up manually.

  * r9138
    Be more minimal in turning on +x bits when svn:executable is set.
    Justification: Needed for r9254 to merge cleanly and stops us from
                   doing a+x.
    Votes:
      +1: breser, sussman, kfogel

  * r9254
    Fix for updates to svn:executable files in shared working copies.
    Justification: Hard to use svn:executable in shared working copies
                   without it.
    Notes: r9138 should be merged first.
    Votes:
      +1: philip, dlr, breser

  * r9315
    Change the formating codes used in svn_swig_pl_callback_thunk.
    Justification: The old ones weren't portable and caused problems on Win32.
    Votes:
      +1: breser



Status of 1.0.3:
================

  * r8708
    Use warnings pragma on perl hook-scripts.
    Justification: Perl correctness issue.
    Votes:
       +1: sussman
       -1: breser (Doesn't error out properly on older versions and 
                   needs more discussion).
