 * r37478, r37543, r37544, r37545, r37547
   Support using `svnversion` on files and improve some messages printed by
   `svnversion`.
   Justification:
     Some messages printed by `svnversion` are inconsistent and sometimes
     incorrect:
     $ svnversion /usr
     exported
     $ svnversion /bin/ls
     '/bin/ls' not versioned, and not exported
     $ svnversion VERSIONED_FILE
     'VERSIONED_FILE' not versioned, and not exported
     $ svnversion /nonexistent
     subversion/libsvn_wc/questions.c:90: (apr_err=2)
     svn: '/nonexistent' does not exist
     ^^^
     Messages with these revisions backported:
     $ svnversion /usr
     Unversioned directory
     $ svnversion /bin/ls
     Unversioned file
     $ svnversion VERSIONED_FILE
     NUMBER
     $ svnversion /nonexistent
     '/nonexistent' doesn't exist
