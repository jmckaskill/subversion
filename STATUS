Status of 1.1.4:
================

Showstoppers:

  none

Candidate changes that seem to have become stalled
due to persistent lack of votes:

  * r12075, r12448
    Add pre-0.14 dumpfile compatability.
    Justification: Some very old clients were recently spotted in
    the wild.  And: Dumpfile compatibility is always good.
    Notes: These look good to me, but are complex enough that I'm not
      comfortable +1'ing without testing on an old dumpfile, and I
      haven't done that yet.  -kfogel

      -0: ringstrom (because the patch is non-trivial and there is only a
                     single known pre-0.14 user)
      -0: ghudson (not really comfortable having this code in the trunk,
                   much less 1.1; dumpfile compatibility in general
                   good, pre-0.14 compatibility not so important)
      +0: kfogel

Candidate changes:

Approved changes (further review is welcome, but not required):

  
  * r13222, r13223, r13232
    Rewrite libsvn_fs_fs's auto-merge algorithm
    Justification:
      unacceptable performance (>50 minutes for a small commit) in
      a repository with 300,000 revisions
    Branch:
      1.1.x-r13222@13517
