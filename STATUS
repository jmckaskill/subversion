Status of 1.3.1:
================

  * r17333 and associated test case (copied from trunk)
    Fix issue #2306: modification of "svn:needs-lock" should adjust
    the native file system's read-only attribute within a WC.
    Branch: 1.3.x-r17333
    Justification:
      Backport of a change to trunk which resolves buggy behavior on
      (at least) Windows and Mac OS X, behavior which is inconsistent
      with Linux.
    Notes:
      dlr does not have a Windows development environment, and thus
      cannot adequately test this change.  Additional testing is
      especially important given the heavy amount of modification
      which was necessary when backporting the change from trunk.

  * r18114
    In mailer.py:
    Fix bug: named substitutions gathered from defaults.for_repos were being
    ignored for sections which contained a specific for_repos option.
    Justification:
      This can enable extensive simplification of configurations which want
      to put the repository name into the *_subject_prefix options.

  * r18144, r18164, r18170, r18171, r18184
    and r18037, r18127 (only tools/dev/stress.pl)
    Add support for BDB-4.4 and automatic recovery of wedged databases.
    Justification:
      See above about automatic recovery of wedged databases.
    Note:
      Depends on r18254.

  * r18230
    Fix a memory leak in the Python bindings which causes Trac resync to use
    massive amounts of memory for large repositories.
    Justification:
      Without this fix, Trac can't handle extremely large repositories.
    Notes:
      See http://projects.edgewall.com/trac/ticket/2620

  * r18254
    Fix parenthetisation in the SVN_BDB_VERSION_AT_LEAST macro.
    Justification:
      Avoids precedence bugs when used in boolean expressions.
    Note:
      r18144 et al. depend on this.
