This file tracks the status of releases in the 1.5.x line.

See "Stabilizing and maintaining releases" in trunk/www/hacking.html for
details on how release lines and voting work, what kinds of bugs can
delay a release, etc.


Candidate changes for 1.5.6:
============================

 * r34875
   Fix depth_tests.py 23 issues that sometimes occurs on Windows when a BDB
   repository is not unlocked fast enough to delete it in the testcycle.
   (Reported multiple times by Mark Phippard, Jens Peters and me as failure
   when testing subversion 1.5.x before release)
   Justification:
     Tests that often fail for the wrong reason, might hide real issues
     with our releases.

 * r34919, r34924
   Make svn client to use the 'LFS' capability of 'neon' to allow commits 
   of new file(post-compression) beyond > 2GB in size.
   Note that Neon currently doesn't support > 2GB on Windows, so this only
   fixes this issue on Linux, *BSD and probably MacOS.
   Justification:
     A simple cast limits our maximum upload file size on systems where neon 
     supports larger uploads.

     +1: rhuijben, kameshj

 * r35143, r35145
   Make it impossible to add .svn (and children) to your working copy via 
     svn add --parents .svn/file
     svn mkdir --parents .svn/dir/dir
     svn cp --parents file .svn/dir/file
   Note: Small merge conflict in the tests lists of basic_tests.py.
   Justification:
     Failing to catch this breaks our administrative area handling.
   Votes:
     +1: rhuijben

 * r35250, r35286
   Fix the error handling logic of the get-location-segments REPORT code
   in mod_dav_svn.
   Justification:
     This causes inconsistencies across the RA layers, and those
     confusing client-side XML parsing errors that fuss about
     responses with 200 status codes.
   Votes:
