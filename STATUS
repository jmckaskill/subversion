This file tracks the status of releases in the 1.3.x line.

See "Stabilizing and maintaining releases" in trunk/www/hacking.html for
details on how release lines and voting work, what kinds of bugs can
delay a release, etc.

Status of 1.3.1:
================

Candidate changes:

  * r17280, r18172
    Upgrade SWIG bindings to be compatible with SWIG 1.3.26 and 1.3.27.
    Branch: 1.3.x-r17280-r18172

  * r17333 and associated test case (copied from trunk)
    Fix issue #2306: modification of "svn:needs-lock" should adjust
    the native file system's read-only attribute within a WC.
    Branch: 1.3.x-r17333
    Justification:
      Backport of a change to trunk which resolves buggy behavior on
      (at least) Windows and Mac OS X, behavior which is inconsistent
      with Linux.
    Notes:
      dlr does not have a Windows development environment, and thus
      cannot adequately test this change.  Additional testing is
      especially important given the heavy amount of modification
      which was necessary when backporting the change from trunk.

  * r17829, r17831
    Fix issue # 1456: Subversion RedHat RPMs have bad interaction with NFS
    server/client.  This was easily accomplished by just making a package
    change to set the -rpath correctly during package building.
    Justification:
      Prevents spurious NFS and AUTOMOUNT messages in log files.

    Fix bug: named substitutions gathered from defaults.for_repos were being
    ignored for sections which contained a specific for_repos option.

  * r18144, r18164 and r18037, r18127 (only tools/dev/stress.pl)
    Add support for BDB-4.4 and automatic recovery of wedged databases.
    Justification:
      See above about automatic recovery of wedged databases.

Approved changes:

  * r18146
    Don't block waiting for background jobs of hook scripts.
    Justification:
      Regression (introduced in 1.3.0), which can delay a Subversion
      server's response when triggering a hook which backgrounds a
      long-runinng process.

  * r17992
    In the Python bindings, check more carefully whether the application_pool
    is valid before allowing child pools to be destroyed.
    Justification: Fixes warnings about assertion failures reported during
    garbage collection when running Trac 0.9.x in CGI mode. See 
      http://projects.edgewall.com/trac/ticket/2472
