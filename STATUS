This file tracks the status of releases in the 1.2.x line.

See "Stabilizing and maintaining releases" in trunk/HACKING for
details on how release lines and voting work, what kinds of bugs can
delay a release, etc.

Status of 1.2.0:
================

Candidate changes:

  * r14643, r14647, r14650
    Use heap not stack for SVN_STREAM_CHUNK_SIZE buffers.
    Justification:
      Buffers simply too big to put on stack; also, API change.
    Notes:
      Use http://svn.collab.net/repos/svn/branches/1.2.x-r14643 for backport.
      All revisions are on the branch.
      markphip: 
      Built and manually tested r14651 on Win32 with these three changes
      merged.  Subclipse and TortoiseSVN both appear to work correctly
      and the JavaHL merge problem is now fixed.
