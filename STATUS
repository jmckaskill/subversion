This file tracks the status of releases in the 1.7.x line.

See http://subversion.apache.org/docs/community-guide/releasing.html#release-stabilization
for details on how release lines and voting work, what kinds of bugs can
delay a release, etc.

Status of 1.7.1:

Candidate changes:
==================

 * r1146131 and followups
   Add svn_fs_verify() and implement rep-cache verification in FSFS using it.
   Branch:
     1.7.x-fs-verify
   Justification:
     Would be nice to extend verify already in 1.7.x.
   Notes:
     This does not include progress reporting; that has been postponed to 1.8.
   Conflicts:
     On fs_fs.c.  Resolve with 'theirs-conflict'.
   Votes:
     +1: danielsh, rhuijben
     +0: gstein (progress would be nice) (without r1161164, r1161180)
     -0: cmpilato (For a function with this name, the implementation is far
         too anemic. I'd prefer this be a private function in 1.7.x, leaving
         room for a future public API that really does full verification.)
         (without r1161164, r1161180)

 * r1147540, r1147541
   Remove unused variables in build system.
   Justification:
     Backporting of future changes will be easier.
   Votes:
     +1: arfrever
     -0: stsp (we can backport these when we need to)
     -0: gstein

 * r1163243, r1163383
   Fix issue #3791 'svn mergeinfo shows natural history of added subtrees
   as eligible'.
   Justification:
     The 'svn mergeinfo [ -R | --depth [ files | immediates | infinity ] ]'
     subcommand gives incorrect answers in some use cases.
   Notes:
     r1163243 is a test for the issue, r1163383 is the fix.
   Votes:
     +1: pburba, rhuijben

 * r1178942, r1182527
   Fix issue #4009, "Big trivial text files merged MUCH slower than binary"
   Justification:
     Much improved merge performance for, well, trivial text file merges!
   Votes:
     +1: stsp, pburba

 * r1185280, r1185282
   Open SQLite databases as writable in some test code before we try to update
   the database.
   Justification:
     General correctness and the tests start failing after r1185242.
   Votes:
     +1: rhuijben
   
 * r1185242
   Don't enable the SQLite shared process cache.
   Justification:
     Resolves common errors of multithreaded application users.
   Notes:
     See also log message of this revision.
     If r1185280 isn't applied before this patch the op-depth tests will
     start failing.
   Votes:
     +1: rhuijben (after r1185280 has been backported)
     +1: ivan

 * r1185746, r1186059
   Fix up some erroneous "Could not frob some targets because..." warnings.
   Votes:
     +1: stsp

 * r1185738, r1185763, r1185768, r1185886
   Add support for upgrading absent nodes to the wonderfull wc-ng world.
   Justification:
     This should have been part of 1.7.0. Without this patch it is impossible
     to upgrade working copies with server excluded/absent directories.
   Notes:
     r1185738, r1185763, r1185768: adds a test for this problem.
     r1185886: fixes this issue and cleans up whitespace in the test.
   Votes:
     +1: rhuijben

 * r1185911, r1185918
   Fix reporting of depth empty directories
   Justification:
     Without this patch 'svn update' sometimes tries to apply updates to nodes
     that don't exist locally.
     (1.6 received the same nodes but filtered the incoming data before
      applying it to the working copy)
   Notes:
     r1185911 adds a simple test for this case and r1185918 resolves this
     regression.
   Votes:
     +1: rhuijben

Veto-blocked changes:
=====================

Approved changes:
=================

 * r1164426, r1164614
   Fix STMT_SELECT_NODE_CHILDREN_WALKER_INFO for correctness and speed.
   Justification:
     Recursive info and propset don't scale well with large working copies
     and may possibly act on the wrong nodes.  Correctness discussion:
     http://colabti.org/irclogger/irclogger_log/svn-dev?date=2011-09-02#l214
     On a Linux machine with a Subversion trunk working copy on a local disk
     running 'svn info --depth infinity' shows it to be 2 or 3 times faster.
     On a larger working copy it's orders of magnitude faster.
   Votes:
     +1: philip, stsp
     +1: rhuijben (works better than the original code, but there are better
                   ways for 1.8+)
     +0: peters, gstein (looks correct, but I didn't test, and while
                         performance should be better, I wonder if that's
                         been tested at all)

 * r1185222
   Make 'svn add --parents D/file' work if D is deleted.
   'svn add D; svn add D/file' would work. 
   Justification:
     Makes it easier to use 'svn add --parents'.
     Reported on the AnkhSVN error list a few times. It's better to apply this
     fix here than having to fix all clients.
   Votes:
     +1: rhuijben, pburba, stsp

 * r1178280, r1178282
   Add a sanity check to FSFS.
   Justification:
     Detects a user-visible corruption seen on svn-master.apache.org.
   Votes:
     +1: danielsh, rhuijben, stsp
