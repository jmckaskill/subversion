================

Candidate changes:

 * r17039, r17051
   Fix issue 767: Commit uses temporary file in current directory.
   Remark:
     Commits in read-only directories therefore fail.  This revision adds
     graceful fallback.

 * r17082
   Fix atexit handler in Python bindings to only destroy the application
   pool if it is still valid.
   Justification:
     Destroying an invalid application pool is bad.
