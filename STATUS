Status of 1.2.1:
================

Candidate changes:

  * r14859
    Fix bug where an unlocked file loses its executable bits when
    svn:executable is set.
    Justification:
      Buggy interaction between locking and svn:executable.
    Votes:
      +1: fitz

  * r14774, r14849, r14851
    Fix locking bug when working on a switched file in the wc.
    Justification:
      Old behavior caused the wrong file to be locked.
    Notes: 
      14774 is the commit of the test, 14849 is the fix.

      +1: fitz

  * r14830
    Fix of the Windows Installer's Add/Repair/Remove capabilities.
    Branch:
      innosetup-hsuninsfix-5x-1.2.x (-r14715:14716)
    Justification:
      This fixes problems people had when using Windows'
      add/remove item in the Control Panel.
    Notes:
      Use backport branch because tree-reorganization defeats a simple
      merge from trunk.
    Votes:
      +0: dlr (concept, no testing environment), fitz (concept)

  * r14116, r14722, r14759
    Optimize 'svn log' performance.
    Justification:
      The new --limit option does not help speed as much without this.
    Notes:
      r14722 depends on r14116, which is just comment fixes.
    Votes:
      +1 (not r14116): djh
      +1: lundblad, fitz

  * r14755
    Don't initialize libsvn_ra in svnversion:
    Justification:
      svnversion doesn't use the RA layer, and it only depends on it
      indirectly.
    Votes:
      +1: lundblad, fitz
