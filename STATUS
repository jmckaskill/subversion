This file tracks the status of releases in the 1.5.x line.

See "Stabilizing and maintaining releases" in trunk/www/hacking.html for
details on how release lines and voting work, what kinds of bugs can
delay a release, etc.

Note: Because we anticipate a reasonable amount of new development
will still be required for Subversion 1.5, we are for the time being
applying the "somewhat looser voting system for areas that are not
core code" to the entire branch.

Status of 1.5.0:
================

Candidate changes:

 * r30335
   Allow NULL log messages in svn_ra_get_commit_editor2, for backwards
   compatibility with Subversion 1.4.

 * r30340, r30342, r30347
   Fix linking issues on cygwin by removing circular dependencies
   between libsvn_fs_{base,fs}/libsvn_fs and libsvn_ra_neon/libsvn_ra.
   (This also resolves linking issues with the ctypes python bindings.)
