================

Candidate changes:

    Extra python tests for authz validation: copy, delete, move, cat, log, 
    checkout, lock and diff. These tests depend on the no-working-copy 
    sandbox feature introduced in r19713.
    Justification:
      Tests how secure Subversion is.

  * r19700, r19753, r19829
    Error out for limit arguments that are less than or equal to zero,
    since they don't make sense, plus a test for it.

      Minor issue, non-intrusive fix.

  * r19746
    Python test for fix for issue 2275
    Justification:
      Fix is already included in 1.4.x (r19509)
    Votes:
      +1: lgo, dlr

  * r19841
    Check cmdline arguments and report errors in svn-backup-dumps.py.
    The tool showed a python backtrace instead of a useful error message.
    Justification:
      Not everyone can interpret a python backtrace.
