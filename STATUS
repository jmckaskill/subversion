This file tracks the status of releases in the 1.0.x line.

See "Stabilizing and maintaining releases" in trunk/HACKING for
details on how release lines and voting work, what kinds of bugs can
delay a release, etc.

Status of 1.0.1:
================

1.0.1 is currently scheduled for Tuesday, 9 March 2004.  A thought: it
would be nice if all changes could be *committed* by the beginning of
Friday, March 5th (er, UTC), so we have a period in which there's
something stable to test.

Candidate changes:

  * r8550
    Make failed direct-URL commits clean up their fs txns (issue #1726)
    Justification:  users have noticed extra fs txns lying around.
    Notes:  just add 3 calls to abort_edit() to cleanup the sloppiness.

      -1: cmpilato (this change is a fix followup to r8490, which is not
                    going to live in 1.0.x line since it changes an API)
