This file tracks the status of releases in the 1.0.x line.

See "Stabilizing and maintaining releases" in trunk/HACKING for
details on how release lines and voting work, what kinds of bugs can
delay a release, etc.

Status of 1.0.1:
================

1.0.1 is currently scheduled for Tuesday, 9 March 2004.  A thought: it
would be nice if all changes could be *committed* by the beginning of
Friday, March 5th (er, UTC), so we have a period in which there's
something stable to test.

Candidate changes:

  * r8431
    Bugfix to commits: allow deletions below schedule-add-with-history dirs.
    Justification:  reported by a user, an unnecessary restriction.
    Notes:  change just sets a flag differently for this case.  See #830.

    Votes:
       +1: kfogel, cmpilato, jszakmeister
  
  * r8883
    Check apr_sockaddr_info_get() return value in svnserve.
    Justification: Fixes a segmentation fault if an invalid hostname
    is specified.
    Notes: This was originally reported here: http://bugs.debian.org/235755

      +1: dwhedon, jerenkrantz, rooneg

  * r8867, r8868, r8902
    Trivial performance fix for mod_authz_svn; cache the access file per
    connection instead of reloading it per request.
    Justification: Saves at least 2 loads of the access file per update, plus
    an additional number of times equal to the number of entries in the REPORT
    response.
    Notes: Similar code has been present in mod_dav_svn to cache an open
    filesystem per connection.
    Votes:
      +1: striker
      -0: kfogel  (Reviewed the change; it's not *so* trivial, and I'm
                   not sure an optimization like this belongs in a
                   patch release.)

  * r8933
    Comply with our license per clause 3.
    Justification: Avoids any problems with downstream packagers having to
    work to comply with our license.
