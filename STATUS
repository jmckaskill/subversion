This file tracks the status of releases in the 1.2.x line.

See "Stabilizing and maintaining releases" in trunk/HACKING for
details on how release lines and voting work, what kinds of bugs can
delay a release, etc.

Status of 1.2.0:
================

  * r14675
    Fix major autoversioning interoperabliity bug.
    Justification:
      Without this bugfix, many DAV clients won't work against mod_dav_svn.
    Notes:
      Very tiny amount of code-churn.  Touches many files only because 
      it's a public API change.
