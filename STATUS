Status of 1.4.0:
================

Candidate changes:
      
  * r19919
    Fix SVN_CONFIG_NICE to work with autoconf 2.60-dev CVS and prereleases,
    which clobber configure arguments in AC_INIT. 
    Justification:
      Developer convenience throughout the lifetime of 1.4.x.
      Note that affected versions are already packaged within Debian etch.
    Concerns:
      Adds a config.nice.old file that has no relevance to this fix.

  * r20562
    API: Use named, not anonymous, structs and enums in new-in-1.4 cases, for
    consistency with the majority of existing cases.
    Concerns:
      All this does is introduce extraneous symbols into the global namespace.
