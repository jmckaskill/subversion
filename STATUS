Status of 1.7.3:

Candidate changes:
==================

 * r1147540, r1147541
   Remove unused variables in build system.
   Justification:
     Backporting of future changes will be easier.
   Votes:
     +1: arfrever
     -0: stsp (we can backport these when we need to)
     -0: gstein

 * r1201072, r1205188, r1205209
   Fix issue #4050 "'svn mergeinfo' always considers non-inheritable ranges
   as partially merged".
   Justification:
     'svn mergeinfo' gave incorrect answers in what is admittedly an edge
     case, but the fix is very simple.
   Notes:
     r1201072 and r1205188 are a new test and minor tweak respectively.
     r1205209 is the fix.
   Votes:
     +1: pburba, rhuijben

 * r1207555, r1207808
   mod_dontdothat: contrib/ -> tools/ and relicense under ALv2.
   Justification:
     ASF infra is using this so we should maintain it.
     Stuff in contrib/ isn't officially maintained.
   Notes:
     r1207555: Perform the move (from r1207550) and relicense
     r1207808: Enable building mod_dontdothat from our standard make scripts.
   Votes:
     +1: rhuijben, stsp

 * r1210147, r1202132, r1202333, r1220740
   Fix the 'svn log --diff' code so that it correctly shows a diff of a
   target file (or directory) that was at a different path in the past.
   Previously it would error out. A test is included.
   Branch:
     ^/subversion/branches/1.7.x-r1210147
   Notes:
    Depends on the r1220783 bug fix, otherwise the test will fail on Windows.
    r1210147 is the actual fix.
    r1202132 and r1202333 were merged for conflict resolution. These revisions
    depend on the issue #2873 fix which has been backported in 1.7.2
    r1220740 expands the test so that it would fail without r1210147 applied.
   Votes:
     +1: stsp (without r1220740 -- r1220740 depends on r1220783 which
               in turn needs new-in-1.8 APIs. Are there test failures
               on Windows without it that cannot be fixed some other way?)
     +1: julianfoad

 * r1221178, r1221303
   Fix issue 4086, mod_dav_svn's handling of POST errors.
   Justification:
     Regression when using the v2 protocol.
   Votes:
     +1: philip, rhuijben

 * r1221463
   Allow leading "r" in ?p= query string arguments.
   Justification:
     Same as for allowing '-r r42' in svn(1).
   Votes:
     -0: rhuijben (Behavior change without positive votes? 1.8?)

 * r1221767, r1221780
   Fix SVNParentPath listings for parent paths which contain symlinks.
   This was supposed to have been fixed by r1132782, but that solution
   had problems of its own.
   Notes:
     r1221767 is code formatting only, needed to avoid a conflict
   Votes:
     +1: cmpilato (r1221780 only)
     +1: philip, rhuijben

 * r1179776, r1222628, r1222644, r1222699, r1236283, r1236343
   Improve another error message coming from SASL.
   Justification:
     Similar fixes already went into 1.7.1.
   Branches:
     ^/subversion/branches/1.7.x-r1236343
   Votes:
     +1: rhuijben (r1222628, r1222644, r1222699 only)
     +1: philip, stsp

 * r1225491
   Allow converting //server/share paths to file://server/share by using
   svn_uri_get_file_url_from_dirent().
   Justification:
     Fixes api to allow running tests on UNC shares.
   Votes:
     +1: rhuijben, steveking

 * r1230212
   Fix for large files on 32-bit systems
   Justification:
     Can corrupt FSFS repository.
   Votes:
     +1: philip, rhuijben

 * r1231029
   Fix issue 4097, XML status not showing new files in repository.
   Justification:
     Regression from 1.6.
   Votes:
     +1: philip, rhuijben

 * r1232202, r1232207, r1232221, r1232222 
   Calling 'svn status PATH' on a node that is not present in a working
   copy shouldn't show the status as missing.
   Justification:
     Calling svn status on non-versioned paths should just work.
     Resolves a weird side effect from moving files in AnkhSVN.
   Branch:
     ^/subversion/branches/1.7.x-r1232221
   Notes:
     The actual fix had to be reimplemented on the branch as the relevant code
     was refactored since branching 1.7.x.
   Votes:
     +1: rhuijben, steveking

 * r1232413, r1236099
   Improve server certificate error collection code.
   Notes:
     r1232413 updates serf.
     r1236099 updates neon.
     The changes are independent, but as it changes how the config file
     behaves, I think both should be applied at the same time. (rhuijben)
     r1236099 is the neon equivalent of the serf change r1235831 but the
     serf change is not nominated. (philip)
     Needs branch as r1236099 gives a merge conflict. (philip)
   Votes:
     +1: rhuijben, gstein

 * r1236173
   Do canonicalization rather than requring canonical data in some
   mod_dav_svn requests.
   Justification:
     Backward compatibility with 1.6 clients when using URLs such
     as http://host:80/rep%6f that 1.7 considers non-canonical.
   Votes:
     +1: philip

 * r1146762, r1201419, r1227237, r1227250, r1227352, r1227372, r1227384,
   r1227385
   Fix issue #4059, "can't commit when copy-op-root and copied-along
   grandchild are explicit targets".
   Justification:
     Some copies can't be committed. Users complained.
   Notes:
     +-----------------------------------+
     | Merge with --accept=mine-conflict |
     +-----------------------------------+
     r1146762 avoids a semantic conflict
     r1201419 adds a regression test
     r1227237 is a comment fix
     r1227250 is an indentation fix
     r1227352 is merged to avoid a conflict and improves an error message
     r1227372 is a follow-up test fix for previous
     r1227384 prepares the actual fix and needs --accept=mine-conflict
     r1227385 is the actual fix
   Votes:
     +1: stsp

Veto-blocked changes:
=====================

 * r1146131 and followups
   Add svn_fs_verify() and implement rep-cache verification in FSFS using it.
   Branch:
     1.7.x-fs-verify
   Justification:
     Would be nice to extend verify already in 1.7.x.
   Notes:
     This does not include progress reporting; that has been postponed to 1.8.
   Conflicts:
     On fs_fs.c.  Resolve with 'theirs-conflict'.
   Votes:
     +1: danielsh, rhuijben
     +0: gstein (progress would be nice) (without r1161164, r1161180)
     -0: cmpilato (For a function with this name, the implementation is far
         too anemic. I'd prefer this be a private function in 1.7.x, leaving
         room for a future public API that really does full verification.)
         (without r1161164, r1161180)
     -1: danielsh (invasive, new feature)

 * r1220783
   Fix mis-ordered text output of 'svn log --diff' on Windows.
   Justification:
     Badness within 'svn', fixed within 'svn'. Needed for r1210147 group.
   Notes:
     Doesn't compile on 1.7.x.
   Votes:
     +1: julianfoad, rhuijben
     -1: stsp (doesn't compile and would need new-in-1.8 public APIs).
