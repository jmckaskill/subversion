Candidate changes:

  * r9861
    fixes reentrancy problem for javahl binding. The pool for a call could be
    destroyed before the end of the call. This could crash the jvm
    Justification: javahl binding only fix to prevent a crash

      +0: breser

  * r9883, r9905
    Fix for crash in javahl binding. If the first parameter of SVNClient.list
    is null, the jvm will crash. r9905 is the result of a scan of the binding
    code searching for this problem in all possible places.
    Justification: javahl binding only fix to prevent a crash

  * r8027
    Passing a Revision.DateSpec in javahl failed with 
    java.lang.NoSuchFieldError because java.util.Date.getTime() was 
    searched as a field when it is a method. 
    Justification: small change in javahl binding only

  * r9338, r9340
    Add various missing library dependencies to build.conf, for various

  * r10132, r10136, 10138, 10139

    Allow properties with colons in their name to be read with propget

  * r10616, r10638, r10642
    Work around directory creation bug in APR shipped with httpd 2.0.50.
    Justification:
      Not a tiny patch, but most of the pieces are simple and
      independent.  Bug breaks shared working copies and litters
      unsightly sticky bits around people's working copies and
      repositories.

  * r10819, r10855
    Avoid repository corruption if executed with closed std{in,out,err}
    Justification:
      Simple fix for a nasty problem that has bitten at least one user.

       +1: bliss, breser, ghudson

  * Issue #1862
    Fix the 'file not found' update error.
    Notes:
      The patch is unique to 1.0.x because of the reporter rewrite in
      1.1.x/trunk.  The log message and patch are attached to the issue.
      Here is the URL to the attachment for the impatient:
      http://subversion.tigris.org/nonav/issues/showattachment.cgi/389/issue1862.diff
    
    Justification: Lots and lots of TSVN users are hit by this.

  * r10112, r10113, r10215, r10440, r10441, r10458, r10711, r10775
    Backport Perl bindings fixes from the 1.1.x branch
    Justification:
      Completeless and many leak fixes.  Note that FreeBSD ports has been using
      this diff and several people tested it.
    Notes:
      Merging directly would fail since there has been tree reoreganization.

  * r10841
    Fix crash bug in "svn st -u" on out-of-sync working copies
    Justification:
      Crashes bad.
    Notes:
      (lundblad and jpieper voted for this on 1.1.x, maybe they want to
       vote for it here)
