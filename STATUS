Status of 1.1.5:
================

Candidate changes that seem to have become stalled
due to persistent lack of votes:

  * r12075, r12448
    Add pre-0.14 dumpfile compatability.
    Justification: Some very old clients were recently spotted in
    the wild.  And: Dumpfile compatibility is always good.
    Notes: These look good to me, but are complex enough that I'm not
      comfortable +1'ing without testing on an old dumpfile, and I
      haven't done that yet.  -kfogel

      +1: maxb, dionisos
      -0: ringstrom (because the patch is non-trivial and there is only a
                     single known pre-0.14 user)
      -0: ghudson (not really comfortable having this code in the trunk,
                   much less 1.1; dumpfile compatibility in general
                   good, pre-0.14 compatibility not so important)
      +0: kfogel

Candidate changes:

  * r12694

    Votes:

  * r13983
    Correct valid warnings and bogus compilation errors specific to
    Jikes.
    Justification:

    Votes:
      +1: dlr

  * r14041.
    Fix issue #2268 (svn update of xml-unsafe dir (from within) http error)
