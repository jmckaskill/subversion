This file tracks the status of releases in the 1.6.x line.

See "Stabilizing and maintaining releases" in trunk/www/hacking.html for
details on how release lines and voting work, what kinds of bugs can
delay a release, etc.

Status of 1.6.10:
================

Candidate changes:

 * r878078, r878088, r878102, r878196
   Make KWallet window attached to terminal window.
   Justification:
     Without this change, KWallet window can appear behind terminal window
     and is left after killing terminal.
   Votes:
     +1: arfrever
     -0: peters, stsp (without r878196) (code is ugly and Linux-specific -
                                            would getenv("WINDOWID") work
                                            instead?)

 * r878216, r878341, r878343, r876862, r877203, r877595, r877665, r877597, r878269,
   r878321, r878399, r878423, r878426
   Fix issue #3432 'Merge can record mergeinfo from natural history gaps'
   Justification:
     Gaps in merge sources can lead to the creation of invalid mergeinfo
     or the removal of valid mergeinfo.
   Notes:     
     The fix itself in r878399 is relatively simple, but recent refactoring
     of the merge code on trunk makes it look a lot worse than it is.
     Unless otherwise noted, all of the following are nominated simply to
     avoid a conflict nightmare:
     r878216, r878341, r878343 - New test and test tweaks for the issue.
     r876862 - Comment changes only.
     r877203 - Scope reduction of a pool.
     r877595 - Minor bug fix and some refactoring.
     r877665 - Comment changes only.
     r877597 - Merge code refactoring.
     r878269 - Pool use cleanup, no functional change.
     r878321 - More merge code refactoring.
     r878423 - Variable rename to avoid shadowing a previous local.
     r878426 - Remove an unused variable.

 * r876032, r876104, r878447, r878910, r878911, r878916
   Several fixes to the Win32 exception handler. This change also makes it
   available on Windows Vista and 7 where it was previously blocked by a
   version check.
   Justification:
     This exception handler is a valuable debugging tool for users who don't
     have development tools installed. (Most users on Windows).
   Notes:
     Most of these revisions cancel out each other. The real changes are in
     r878447 (removing version check) and r878910,r878916 (fixing formatting
     specifier). It's probably easier to review the combined patch than the
     individual revisions.
   Branch:
     ^/subversion/branches/1.6.x-r38836.
   Votes:
     +1: rhuijben
     +0: pburba - I don't have a Vista or Win7 box to try this out on, but it
         works fine on my XP box.
     +0: lgo - code reviewed and looks good, but I don't have access to a
         Windows machine.

 * r879766
   Fix issue #3498: Subversion password stores freeze Eclipse
   Justification:
     All subclipse users are in great need of this.
   Branch:
     Resolves a minor conflict in libsvn_auth_gnome_keyring/gnome_keyring.c
     where the code changed was refactored on trunk.
     ^/subversion/branches/1.6.x-r39692
   Votes:
     +1: stylesen
     +0: julianfoad (reviewed, not tested)
     -0: rhuijben (needs more explanation: The not-interactive and no
                   callback code paths should be more similar if the code
                   works correctly. I think the not interactive code path
                   needs the same fix).

 * r879902, r879916
   Disables file synchronization mutexes in fsfs on Windows. These mutexes
   were added to make POSIX systems lock files that were in use by other
   threads in the same process.
   
   Windows implements per filehandle locking, so it doesn't need these
   locks. We usually see the opposite problem in Subversion on Windows.
   Justification:
     This gives a measurable performance boost (5% decrease in running time
     on running the testsuite in parallel mode (on trunk). The difference
     will be bigger when measured on a real subversion server like one
     running apache or svnserve.
   Votes:
     +1: rhuijben

 * r880552
   Try to enable TCP keep-alives in svnserve.
   Justification:
     ra_svn clients do this, too. It should not do any harm.
     Is likely to fix hanging svnserve processes which still linger
     blocking on reads from sockets after days of inactivity on the
     connection, a problem seen and reported by MPlayer developers in #svn.
   Votes:
     +1: stsp, rhuijben

 * r892050, 892085
   Fix a reintegrate bug which can occur when the merge source has mergeinfo
   that explicitly describes common history with the reintegrate target.
   Justification:
     Reintegrate merges may not work if the reintegrate source has self-
     referential mergeinfo that is also self-referential to the reintegrate
     target.  This occured in our own repository, see
     http://svn.haxx.se/dev/archive-2009-12/0338.shtml.

 * r891672
   Fix issue #3552 - File external from URL cannot overwrite the existing
   versioned item
   Justification:
     This defect affects 'subversive' client users in 1.6.x.
   Notes:
     The backport branch exists in order to make the patch compatible with
     1.6.x tests. r876917 introduces 'switched' to wc status which is not 
     available in 1.6.x.

 * r896915
   On Windows, stop retrying a move operation without looking to the
   initial error code. 
   Justification:
     Without this patch the initial move error is lost, which makes it
     impossible to diagnose the real error.
   Votes:
     +1: rhuijben

 * r898048
   Extend the Windows only, crypto api verification of server certificates
   to check for certificate revocation. Also simplify the code by making
   Windows do the chain verification instead of just taking an intermediate
   result.
   Justification:
     It's better to be safe, when we are talking about SSL.
   Votes:
     +1: rhuijben

 * r898963, r899826, r899828
   Fix issue #3501 - Repos & wc issues with some NFS clients, notably NetBSD,
   due to buggy interaction between unlink, rewinddir, and NFS caching.
   Branch resolves two trivial conflicts.
   Justification:
     Bug reporter says, "For me, this problem forces us to stay with
     Subversion 1.4."
   Notes:
     rhuijben: This patch triggers several errors in the python test suite
               for me. File Deletes are asynchronous on Windows and after
               applying this patch some delete calls in our test suite's
               cleanup code get an access denied, which is not handled there.
               The tests themselves complete successfully.
   Branch:
     ^/subversion/branches/1.6.x-r898963
   Votes:
     +1: peters, rhuijben

 * r901752
   Allow 'svn log' on an uncommitted copy/move destination.
   Notes:
     svn_client_log5 API promises that unspecified peg revisions default
     to svn_opt_revision_working for WC paths; prior to r901752 we were
     not keeping this promise.
   Justification:
     APIs should do what they say they do.
   Votes:
     +1: pburba
 
 * r904301, r904394
   Update every occurence of the Subversion repository URL to apache.org,
   except in CHANGES (for sentimental reasons, I guess).
   Justification:
     Tools and doc references should point at the new locations.
   Votes:
     +1: neels

* r904594
  Update 'svnadmin verify' to recognize malformed/missing revprops files
  Justification:
    It's misleading for 'svnadmin verify' to say a repository is fine
    when in reality it isn't.
  Votes:
    +1: jwhitlock, danielsh

 * r905303
   Make 'svnadmin hotcopy' copy fsfs.conf for FSFS repositories.
   Justification:
     svnadmin hotcopy is supposed to copy all files.
   Votes:
     +1: stsp

  * r905326
    Issue #3561: Teach ra_serf the same out-of-date fix we taught ra_neon.
    Justification:
      Feature parity with ra_neon is goodness and fixes real-world issue.
   Branch:
     ^/subversion/branches/1.6.x-r905326
    Votes:
      +1: jerenkrantz, kameshj

 * r906256, 906305
   Fix issue #3573 'local non-inheritable mergeinfo changes not properly
   merged with updated mergeinfo'
   Notes:
   Justification:
     svn:mergeinfo should be mergeable, but in this issue mergeinfo changes
     brought down by an update were not properly merged with local changes.
   Notes:
     r906256 is a test demonstrating the problem and r906305 is the fix.
   Branch:
     ^/subversion/branches/1.6.x-issue3573

     +1: pburba

 * r877016, r902093
   Fix issue #3390 'relative externals not updated during switch'.
   Justification:
     One of the selling points of relative externals was their ability
     to be used to span branches and tags.  Not so useful if switching
     to a different tag or branch doesn't actually cause the external
     to point to the right place.

Veto-blocked changes:
=====================

 * r877552, r877617, r877618, r877619, r877621
   Support using `svnversion` on files and improve some messages printed by
   `svnversion`.
   Justification:
     Some messages printed by `svnversion` are inconsistent and sometimes
     incorrect:
     $ svnversion /usr
     exported
     $ svnversion /bin/ls
     '/bin/ls' not versioned, and not exported
     $ svnversion VERSIONED_FILE
     'VERSIONED_FILE' not versioned, and not exported
     $ svnversion /nonexistent
     subversion/libsvn_wc/questions.c:90: (apr_err=2)
     svn: '/nonexistent' does not exist
     ^^^
     Messages with these revisions backported:
     $ svnversion /usr
     Unversioned directory
     $ svnversion /bin/ls
     Unversioned file
     $ svnversion VERSIONED_FILE
     NUMBER
     $ svnversion /nonexistent
     '/nonexistent' doesn't exist
   Votes:
     +1: arfrever
     -0: cmpilato (Introduces new features and changes output)
     -1: rhuijben (Introduces new features and changes output;
                   I think it should be removed from STATUS)
