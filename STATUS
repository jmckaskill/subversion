Status of 1.1.0:
================

Candidate changes:

  * r10604
    Cleanup some qsort-related stuff.
    Justification:
      Removes *4* redundant functions, but adds a new API.
    Notes:
      The docstring for svn_sort_compare_paths says "New in 1.1."
      and needs to be updated to say 1.2 if this does not go in.
    Votes:
      -0: ghudson, lundblad (what's the point of putting code cleanups into
          1.1?)
      +1: cmpilato

  * r10775
    Wrap svn_config_enumerator_t for Perl bindings.
    Justification:
      Perl bindings only; completeness.
    Votes:
      +1: clkao, breser

  * r10800 (Issue #2031)
    Add -lstdc++ to javahl binding DSO at link-time.
    Justification:
      The javahl shared library does not link correctly on certain platforms.
      (This is really a libtool bug.)

       -1: brane [until someone explains to me why this should be a
                  Unix-only change]

  * r10890
    Run external diff3 with full environment.
    Justification:
      X11 diff3 utilities won't work without it.  One-liner.

  * r10868, r10884
    Improve handling of path to SWIG in configure.

  * r10894
    Allow cancelation during recursive addition of a dir without subdirs.
