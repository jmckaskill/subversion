This file tracks the status of releases in the 1.5.x line.

See "Stabilizing and maintaining releases" in trunk/www/hacking.html for
details on how release lines and voting work, what kinds of bugs can
delay a release, etc.


Candidate changes for 1.5.6:
============================

 * r34875
   Fix depth_tests.py 23 issues that sometimes occurs on Windows when a BDB
   repository is not unlocked fast enough to delete it in the testcycle.
   (Reported multiple times by Mark Phippard, Jens Peters and me as failure
   when testing subversion 1.5.x before release)
   Justification:
     Tests that often fail for the wrong reason, might hide real issues
     with our releases.

 * r34919, r34924
   Make svn client to use the 'LFS' capability of 'neon' to allow commits 
   of new file(post-compression) beyond > 2GB in size.
   Note that Neon currently doesn't support > 2GB on Windows, so this only
   fixes this issue on Linux, *BSD and probably MacOS.
   Justification:
     A simple cast limits our maximum upload file size on systems where neon 
     supports larger uploads.

Approved changes:
=================

 * r35040
   Allow colons within mergeinfo path names.
   Justification:
     Colons in pathnames are legal on many OSes, so it was only a matter
     of time before someone hit this bug, http://subversion.tigris.org/ds/
     viewMessage.do?dsForumId=462&dsMessageId=1005163.
