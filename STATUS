This file tracks the status of releases in the 1.1.x line.

See "Stabilizing and maintaining releases" in trunk/HACKING for
details on how release lines and voting work, what kinds of bugs can
delay a release, etc.

Status of 1.1.0:
================

Candidate changes:

  * r10389, r10398:
    Don't always patch the apr-util files for BDB when generating
    Windows build scripts (introduced in r10206).
    Justification:
      trivial fix, avoids breaking the apr-util build by mistake,
      will make my life easier as long as the 1.1.x branch is live.
      r10389 is a doc and utility fix for r10206.
    Votes:
      +3: brane. That should be enough :-)
      +0: breser. Don't know enough about the Windows build to be +1

  * r10386, r10388:
    Add IRI support and URI auto-escaping (issue #1910).
    Justification: Nice usability feature, which could go in if we restart
      the soak period for other reasons.
    Note: r10388 is wrong if it goes into 1.1, but I don't want to change it
      before I know if this is accepted...

      -0 breser (I'm still not sure this belongs in 1.1.0, but I don't see
                 anything technically wrong with it).

  * r10353, r10375
    Fix encoding of get_repos_url result.
    Justification: Also fixes a bug in svnserve with encoded
     characters in paths.  See
     http://www.contactor.se/~dast/svn/archive-2004-07/1334.shtml
     for a description of the bug.
    Note: This change is sufficiently big in scope and raw size to
     warrant restarting the soak period.  It would be possible to
     construct a more minimal change for the release branch, but that
     work hasn't been done, and it's not worth it if we're going to
     restart the 1.1 soak anyway.  But don't merge until we've come to
     a decision on whether to restart the 1.1 soak.

      +1: lundblad, ghudson, breser

  * r10400, r10401
    Perl bindings build fixes.
    r10400: Add cygwin to the list of platforms requiring explicit linking of
      apr.
    r10401: Transfer some libsvn_swig_perl dependencies incorrectly listed as
      nonlibs to libs.
    Votes:
      +1: maxb, ghudson, clkao, breser

  * r10422
    Python bindings build fix. Make the compile flags more like distutils uses,
    avoiding large amounts of compiler warnings.
    Votes:
      +1: maxb, ghudson
      +0: breser

  * r10410, r10450
    Python bindings build fix. Explicitly link libpython to the python
    bindings.  r10410 is a trivial usage message update, included to
    avoid merge conflicts.
    Votes:
      +1: maxb
      +0: breser (don't fully understand the python code but looks okay to me)

  * r10458
    Properly return values for ra->get_rev. Allow SVN::Delta::Editor subclasses
    to use invokers provided by the parent class.
    Justification:
      Bindings only, wrapping completeness.
    Votes:
      +1: clkao, breser

  * r10464
    Have mailer.py open repository via svn_repos.h, not svn_fs.h.
    Justification:
       Allows mailer.py to work with fsfs.
    Votes:
      +1: sussman, cmpilato, kfogel, brane
      +0: breser

  * r10473
    Fix OS X build.
    Justification: Should work out of the tarball.
    Votes:
      +1: breser

  * r10480
    Fix handling of non-canonical copyfrom data in FSFS.
    Justification: Without this fix, FSFS repositories will be ever so
     slightly incorrect, and it's better to nip these imprecisions in
     the bud than have to worry about them for years.  And it's a
     small fix.

      +1: ghudson, cmpilato, sussman, breser

  * r10379,r10380,r10384,r10469,r10470,r10487
    Support creation of zip archives for Windows.
    Justification:
      Long since planed.
    Notes:
      r10487 really doesn't need a vote, but I included it for completness.
    Votes:
      +1: breser

  * r10462,r10491,r10493,r10517
    Add 2 new features to the javahl binding. svn info and svn log -v for
    the java client. r10517 is needed to unbreak javahl when r10505 is ported.
    Justification:
      The subclipse (subclipse.tigris.org) people need these patches.
    Notes:
      The feature are implemented, so existing clients do not break.
      r10493 fixes line endings in the Java bindings to be set to native.
    Votes:
      +1: pmayweg
      +0: breser (without r10517)
      +0: kfogel (with r10517, since r10505 is now approved)

  * r10502
    Fix issue 1986:  'svn cp dir1 dir2' when dir1 contains versioned symlink.
    Justification:
      Simple fix: changes the internal implementation of
      svn_io_copy_dirs_recursively() function to notice/copy symlinks. 
      And this is a bug in one of the new svn 1.1 features.
    Votes:
      +1: sussman, ghudson

  * r10505
    Remove 'svn_node_special' from svn_node_kind_t.
    Justification:
      A simple API clensing; we don't want svn 1.1 to have this
      junk.  If it does, we'll have to support it until 2.0.
    Votes:
      +1: sussman, ghudson, cmpilato

  * r10507,r10508,r10509
    Perform checksum verification in FSFS (r10507) and verify file
    contents in 'svnadmin verify' (r10508,r10509).
    Justification: Must keeps the precious data nice and safe
    Votes:
     +1: ghudson, kfogel, brane

  * r10528
     Fix bug in overzealous out-of-dateness commit checks.
     (Allows 'svn cp wc URL' to work correctly. (issue #1994))
    Justification:  
      We recommend 'svn cp wc URL' as a way of tagging in the book,
      so the bug's existence is embarrassing.  Risk is low: it's a
      one-line fix to the logic that we've always intended.
