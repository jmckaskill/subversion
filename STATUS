Status of 1.1.1:
================

Candidate changes:

  * r10788, r10796, r10904, r10914
    Fix performance regression in character encoding translations.  Most
    noticable on Win32, but impacts other platforms as well.
    Justification:
      Slow "svn status" annoys people, especially TSVN users.
    Notes:
      Proposed during 1.1.0 preparation, but it is too late and complicated
      to put in 1.1.0 at this stage.

  * r11202, r11243
    Fix eol-style translation error for propget.

  * r11190
    Make it possible to set SVNPathAuthz to Off.
    Justification:
      There is a performance regression from 1.0 when it's set to On
      (which is why it was implemented in the first place).

  * r11211, r11232, r11285
    Fix performance regression for ls/RA->get_dir over ra_rav.

      +1: brane (only r11211 so far)

  * r11224 (Issue 2070)
    Exporting symlinks with use-commit times set fails.
    Justification:
      Showstopper when using symlinks.  One-liner.

      +1: bliss, lundblad

  * r11250, r11258
    Fix #2060, make ls work when path contians non-ASCII chars over ra_dav.
    Justification:
      BFI, ls-R didn't work at all in this case, affects many GUI clients.

  * r11233, r11260
    Fix eol-style conversion for propedit.
    Justification:
      Editing props with newlines (svn:ignore, svn:log...) is annoying without
      this.
    Note:
      This also fixes --encoding with propedit.

  * r11262, r11274
    Fix issue #2012.  Allow URI-encoded drive letter and separator (: or |).

    Votes:
      +1: lundblad

  * r11215, r11264
      SVN has needed a good packaging script for Win32 since forever.
    Justification:
      This and the related build and test script changes will make
      creating 1.1.x Win32 binary packages a lot easier.
    Votes:
      +1: brane

  * r11290
      Fix an error in the perl bindings.
    Justification:
      Completely breaks Perl bindings for some versions of Perl.
