This file tracks the status of releases in the 1.7.x line.

for details on how release lines and voting work, what kinds of bugs can
delay a release, etc.

Status of 1.7.6:

Candidate changes:
==================

 * r1306275, and too many other revisions to list here
   New diff support code for added/deleted files and directories.
   Fixes issue #4153, "svn log --diff" on moved file gives "not found",
   and other problems.
   Justification:
     The current code (introduced in 1.7.x in the r1207351 backport commit)
     produces inconsistent paths in diff output (see
     http://svn.haxx.se/dev/archive-2012-03/0385.shtml), and it also breaks
     with the paradigm that the target of an editor drive may never have more
     than one path component (which according to cmpilato is an API violation).
   Notes:
     Please read the branch and related trunk log messages for detailed notes
     about these changes.
   Branch:
     ^/subversion/branches/1.7.x-issue4153
   Votes:
     +1: stsp

 * ^/subversion/branches/1.7.x-performance
   Use the working copy status walker as a first filter to find committable
   nodes.
   Justification:
     Huge performance boost. Especially on NFS.
   Notes:
     Backports the status walker framework. Many other parts are backportable
     too, but this branch delivers the plumbing.
   Votes:
     +0: rhuijben (I would like to see some test results before backporting)

 * r1341060
   Sort output of 'svn import'
   Notes: Needs a backport branch, noted here for completeness.
   Votes:
     +0: stsp (pending a proper conflict-free backport)

 * r1368197, r1368198
   Fix issue #4216 ("Error updating relocated working copy with
   server-relative externals defined").
   Justification:
     Fixes user-reported problem.
   Notes:
     r1368197: This contains the actual fix.
     r1368198: This contains some follow-up comment tweaks that help
               explain the relevant code region more thoroughly.
   Votes:
     +1: cmpilato
     
Veto-blocked changes:
=====================

Approved changes:
=================

 * r1362508
   Avoid errors when users run 'svnlook changed', 'svnlook
   dirs-changed', or 'svnlook diff' on r0.  Though the output from
   those requests will always be empty, there's nothing inherently
   wrong with the requests themselves.
   Justification:
     Resolves complaint made by user(s).
