This file tracks the status of releases in the 1.1.x line.

See "Stabilizing and maintaining releases" in trunk/HACKING for
details on how release lines and voting work, what kinds of bugs can
delay a release, etc.

Status of 1.1.0:
================

As of 1.1.0-rc3, 1.1.0 is in its final one-week soak period.  Any code
changes made to 1.1.0 necessitate restarting the final one-week soak.
(See HACKING for the precise definition of which changes necessitate a
resoak.)  If you are proposing a code change for 1.1.0, make a note of
whether it warrants a resoak on its own; otherwise, the change may be
folded in if some other change warrants a resoak, but will be moved to
1.1.1 if not.

Candidate changes:

  * r11054:
    Don't use -std=c89 anymore.

  * r10994 (fixes issue #2054)
    Fix FSFS history code in the presence of multiple copies along a
    path within the same rev.
    Justification:
     Small, safe change.
    Notes:
     Not worth a resoak on its own.

  * r10560
    Sync with APR 1.0 find_apr.m4 and find_apu.m4 files.
    Justification:
     Allows building against APR 1.0; straightforward change.
    Notes:
     Not worth a resoak on its own.
    Votes:
      +1: ghudson, maxb, breser
   
  * r10773
    Fix typo in test case of javahl binding.  
    Justification:
      Tiny javahl binding only fix.
    Notes:
      Not worth a resoak on its own.

  * r10978
    Install and configure Apache modules, install Berkeley DB DLL in Apache's
	module directory and use dynamic APR libs (DLLs)
    Justification:
     The packaged programs will not work without the DLLs and the module and
     and Berkeley DB-DLL handling are higly requested items.

Status of 1.1.1:
================

Candidate changes:

  * r10788, r10796, r10904, r10914
    Fix performance regression in character encoding translations.  Most
    noticable on Win32, but impacts other platforms as well.
    Justification:
      Slow "svn status" annoys people, especially TSVN users.
    Notes:
      Proposed during 1.1.0 preparation, but it is too late and complicated
      to put in 1.1.0 at this stage.
