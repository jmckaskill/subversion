This file tracks the status of releases in the 1.5.x line.

See "Stabilizing and maintaining releases" in trunk/www/hacking.html for
details on how release lines and voting work, what kinds of bugs can
delay a release, etc.

Note: Because we anticipate a reasonable amount of new development
will still be required for Subversion 1.5, we are for the time being
applying the "somewhat looser voting system for areas that are not
core code" to the entire branch.

Status of 1.5.0:
================

Candidate changes:

  * r29962
    Enforce the fact that 'svn merge' requires a merge source.
    Notes:
      Should be in 1.5, because 'svn merge' with no arguments won't
      error otherwise, yet such an invocation is not (currently)
      meaningful, and therefore should error.

  * r29858, r29859, r29876
    Fix some bugs related to merges from foreign repositories,
    including bogus attempts at recording mergeinfo, and the creation of
    corrupt wcprops.
    Notes:
      r29859 isn't required, but minimizes the diff against trunk.
