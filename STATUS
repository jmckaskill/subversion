This file tracks the status of releases in the 1.5.x line.

See "Stabilizing and maintaining releases" in trunk/www/hacking.html for
details on how release lines and voting work, what kinds of bugs can
delay a release, etc.

Note: Because we anticipate a reasonable amount of new development
will still be required for Subversion 1.5, we are for the the time
being applying the "somewhat looser voting system for areas that are
not core code" to the entire branch.

Status of 1.5.0:
================

   Issue #3089: detect mergeinfo capability based on repository support.
   Notes:
     r29358 and r29366 are a pair -- the latter is the real change,
     it just depends on the former for context.
