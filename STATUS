Status of 1.0.2:
================

Candidate changes:

  * r9045

    Votes:
      +1: cmpilato

  * r8708
    Use warnings pragma on perl hook-scripts.
    Justification: Perl correctness issue.
    Votes:
       +1: sussman
       -1: breser (Doesn't error out properly on older versions and 
                   needs more discussion).

    Votes:
      +1: epg, sussman

  * r8867, r8868, r8902
    Trivial performance fix for mod_authz_svn; cache the access file per
    connection instead of reloading it per request.
    Justification: Saves at least 2 loads of the access file per update, plus
    an additional number of times equal to the number of entries in the REPORT
    response.
    Notes: Similar code has been present in mod_dav_svn to cache an open
    filesystem per connection.

      -0: kfogel  (Reviewed the change; it's not *so* trivial, and I'm
                   not sure an optimization like this belongs in a
                   patch release.)

  * r8993, r9002
    Fix deprecation warning from SWIG 1.3.20_ when building the Python
    and Java SWIG bindings.
    Justification: Subsequent releases of SWIG will remove support for
    the old flag.
    Votes:
      +1: dlr, breser

  * r9003
    Include the path to the directory containing libsvn_swig_java in
    SWIG_JAVA_LINK to allow the SWIG Java bindings to actually build.
    Justification: It is not possible to build the SWIG Java bindings
    without this fix.
    Votes:
      +1: dlr
      +0: breser

  * r9089
    Fix broken build of python swig bindings on win32. 
    Justification: single line fix in bindings file which replaces the
    non standard type "long long" with the matching apr type 
    "apr_int64_t". The python bindings will not build without it.
    Votes:
      +0: breser (I haven't tested python bindings but it looks and builds ok)
          dlr

  * r9104
    svn log -v should use forward slash for changed paths on Windows.
    Justification: The paths are for URLS they should be copyable for use on
    repo URLS.
    Votes:
      +1: breser

  * r9212
    Added VC7 support and defines for including debug symbol files.
    Justification: The setup in 1.0.x branch is useless if VC7 is used
    Notes:  The 1.0.1 zip file content was build with VC7 and the Windows
            installer for 1.0.1 had to be set up manually.

  * r9085, r9101, r9109, r9130
    Issue 1509: unable to share working copy.
    Notes: Backport attached to the issue with conflicts removed.
