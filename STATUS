This file tracks the status of releases in the 1.7.x line.

See http://subversion.apache.org/docs/community-guide/releasing.html#release-stabilization
for details on how release lines and voting work, what kinds of bugs can
delay a release, etc.

Status of 1.7.0:

Candidate changes:
==================

 * r1146214, r1146381
   Handle NULL inputs when stringifying svn_checksum_t.
   Justification:
     Avoids segfaults.
   Votes:
     +1: danielsh
     -0: cmpilato, rhuijben, gstein (problem is with callers,
                                     not implementation)
     
 * r1146492
   Add const to a couple members of svn_client_info2_t
   Justification:
     We don't want clients to think they can modify the underlying
     structures. We had similar problems with the svn_wc_status_t,
     and it makes it hard to rev APIs when clients may be monkeying
     with the data we pass along.
   Votes:
     +1: gstein, rhuijben, blair


Approved changes:
=================

 * r1146013
   Improve notifications of paths skipped because they were conflicted
   Justification:
     Improves general usability of the svn client and the libsvn_client api
     and would have to wait for 1.8.0 if it doesn't get in 1.7.0.
   Votes:
     +1: rhuijben, cmpilato, gstein

 * r1146219
   Fix the generated notification.
   Justification:
     Allow API users to more easily distinguish dump from verify.
   Votes:
     +1: danielsh
     +1: rhuijben, gstein (I think this should just go in 1.7.0)

 * r1146222
   Add a NULL check in an error path.
   Justification
     Avoids segfaults.
   Votes:
     +1: danielsh, gstein, stsp, rhuijben

 * r1146274
   Make svn_client_infoX() return proper results for tree conflicts. Without
   this patch the structure is just memcleared instead of properly set to
   uninitialized.
   Justification:
     Resolve regression and remove confusion by future callers.
   Votes:
     +1: rhuijben, gstein, stsp
