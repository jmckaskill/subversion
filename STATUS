This file tracks the status of releases in the 1.3.x line.

See "Stabilizing and maintaining releases" in trunk/www/hacking.html for
details on how release lines and voting work, what kinds of bugs can
delay a release, etc.

Status of 1.3.0:
================

Candidate changes:

  * r16344, r16347, r16358, r16375, r16494
    Provide more complete server-side information about working copy
    items which are out of date in the repository.
    Branch: status-from-repos-enhancements
    Justification:
      This info is extremely useful to Subversion clients; the first
      consumer is likely to be the "Synchronize" view of the Subclipse
      plug-in for the Eclipse IDE.

  * r16350
    Fix issue #1911, where svndumpfilter generated invalid dumpfiles
    when copies occurred and --drop-empty-revs and --renumber-revs
    were in use.
    Justification:
      Invalid dumpfiles are not nice.
    Votes:
      +1: cmpilato
      +0: dlr (concept, new to this area of the code)

  * r16372
    Fix shell test in Makefile breaking swig-py build, due to sometimes
    misidentifying a srcdir == objdir build as a srcdir != objdir build.
    Justification:
      Tiny fix, broken build bad.
    Votes:
      +1: maxb, djames

  * r16388, r16408
    Fix numerous bugs in the svn_fs_*berkeley*() APIs.
    Fix issue 2361 (recover on a FSFS repository errors if BDB not linked).
    Fix creation of BDB files in FSFS repositories by 'svnadmin recover',
      'svnadmin list-dblogs' and 'svnadmin list-unused-dblogs'.
    Justification:
      Not vital, but the creation of Berkeley DB files in a FSFS repository
      is a long standing bug which doesn't really give a good impression.

  * r16398, r16477
    Fix Issue #2172 (segfaults in the Python bindings caused by pool lifetime
    problems).
    Justification:
      Segfaults are bad. In 1.3.x, Python bindings users should not have to
      worry about memory pools.
    Votes:
      +1: djames, dlr
      +1: maxb (r16477 only)

  * r16414, r16512, r16513
    Ensure that SWIG dependencies are correctly added to build-outputs.mk.
    Justification:
      Improves robustness of build system, fixes compile errors
      when user runs `make install-swig-py' without having run
      `make swig-py'.
    Votes:
      +1: djames
      +1: dlr (r16414 and r16513 only)

  * r16428, r16500
    Activate some Windows-specific behaviour on Cygwin too:
     - SVN_ASP_DOT_NET_HACK
     - Windows-specific augmented file:// URLs
    r16500 is a small followup.
    Justification:
      Cygwin is likely to be exposed to native-Windows-created WCs.
    Votes:
      +1: maxb, dlr
     
  * r16486
    Fiddle with the Perl bindings link command to avoid linking to installed,
    rather then build-tree libsvn_* libraries.
    Votes:
      +1: maxb

  * r16510
    Initialize APR pools in libsvn.core, instead of in svn.core.
    Justification:
      Prevents crashes in svn_swig_init_asp_dot_net_hack on WIN32,
      when svn.wc is imported before svn.core. Ensures that the
      global pool is initialized early.

      +1: djames

Approved changes (further review is welcome, but not required):

  * r16495, r16525
    Expose the "out of date" and URI fields now available from the
    svn_wc_status2_t data type to the JavaHL bindings via its Status
    class.
    Justification:
      Bindings should fully reflect the core Subversion API.
      Subclipse will start using these new APIs immediately.
    Notes:
      Depends on the status-from-repos-enhancements branch.
    Votes:
      +1: dlr, jszakmeister

  * r16480
    Remove compatibility code for old versions of SWIG (SWIG 1.3.24 is now
    required).
    Justification:
      Don't want to include vestigial remnants of old SWIG support in the
      release.
    Votes:
      +1: maxb, djames

  * r16508
    Create svn_swig_py_initialize() API function.
    Justification:
      Code style improved, plus helps avoid crash in the dubiously-valid
      case of a static APR library.
