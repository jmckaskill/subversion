================

Candidate changes:

  * r15253
    Fix Issue #2341: Perl bindings cat method fails when using a local file
    repository.
    Justification:
      Repeatedly using the client context to cat files via ra_local from the
      bindings eventually causes the interpreter to die without this fix.
