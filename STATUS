================

Candidate changes:

  (None at the moment.)

Approved changes:

 * r17139
   svnmerge.py: Fix traceback on wrong command line.
   Justification:
     While it is not critical, two stupid bugs can cause tracebacks
     instead of nice error messages on wrong command lines.
   Note:
     The fix is pretty safe, and contains a new set of exhaustive
     tests to make sure nothing else is broken about command line
     handling.

   Don't use recursive symbolic links in our build tree.
   Justification:
