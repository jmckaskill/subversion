This file tracks the status of releases in the 1.1.x line.

See "Stabilizing and maintaining releases" in trunk/HACKING for
details on how release lines and voting work, what kinds of bugs can
delay a release, etc.

Status of 1.1.0:
================

Candidate changes:

  * r10389, r10398:
    Don't always patch the apr-util files for BDB when generating
    Windows build scripts (introduced in r10206).
    Justification:
      trivial fix, avoids breaking the apr-util build by mistake,
      will make my life easier as long as the 1.1.x branch is live.
      r10389 is a doc and utility fix for r10206.
    Votes:
      +3: brane. That should be enough :-)
      +0: breser. Don't know enough about the Windows build to be +1

  * r10386, r10388:
    Add IRI support and URI auto-escaping (issue #1910).
    Justification: Nice usability feature, which could go in if we restart
      the soak period for other reasons.
    Note: r10388 is wrong if it goes into 1.1, but I don't want to change it
      before I know if this is accepted...

      -0 breser (I'm still not sure this belongs in 1.1.0, but I don't see
                 anything technically wrong with it).

  * r10422
    Python bindings build fix. Make the compile flags more like distutils uses,
    avoiding large amounts of compiler warnings.
    Votes:
      +1: maxb, ghudson
      +0: breser

  * r10410, r10450
    Python bindings build fix. Explicitly link libpython to the python
    bindings.  r10410 is a trivial usage message update, included to
    avoid merge conflicts.
    Votes:
      +1: maxb
      +0: breser (don't fully understand the python code but looks okay to me)

  * r10458
    Properly return values for ra->get_rev. Allow SVN::Delta::Editor subclasses
    to use invokers provided by the parent class.
    Justification:
      Bindings only, wrapping completeness.
    Votes:
      +1: clkao, breser

  * r10473
    Fix OS X build.
    Justification: Should work out of the tarball.
    Votes:
      +1: breser

  * r10379,r10380,r10384,r10469,r10470,r10487
    Support creation of zip archives for Windows.
    Justification:
      Long since planed.
    Notes:
      r10487 really doesn't need a vote, but I included it for completness.
    Votes:
      +1: breser

  * r10462,r10491,r10493,r10517
    Add 2 new features to the javahl binding. svn info and svn log -v for
    the java client. r10517 is needed to unbreak javahl when r10505 is ported.
    Justification:
      The subclipse (subclipse.tigris.org) people need these patches.
    Notes:
      The feature are implemented, so existing clients do not break.
      r10493 fixes line endings in the Java bindings to be set to native.
    Votes:
      +1: pmayweg
      +0: breser (without r10517)
      +0: kfogel (with r10517, since r10505 is now approved)

  * r10505
    Remove 'svn_node_special' from svn_node_kind_t.
    Justification:
      A simple API clensing; we don't want svn 1.1 to have this
      junk.  If it does, we'll have to support it until 2.0.
    Votes:
      +1: sussman, ghudson, cmpilato

  * r10528
     Fix bug in overzealous out-of-dateness commit checks.
     (Allows 'svn cp wc URL' to work correctly. (issue #1994))
    Justification:  
      We recommend 'svn cp wc URL' as a way of tagging in the book,
      so the bug's existence is embarrassing.  Risk is low: it's a
      one-line fix to the logic that we've always intended.
