Status of 1.2.2:
================

Candidate changes:

  * r15248
    Perl bindings: Make compatible with SWIG 1.3.25.
    Justification:
      Distributions will start to update to the new version, and will
      require support to continue building subversion-perl packages.
    Votes:
      +1: maxb

  * r15233
    Reduce memory consumption by the client when performing merge
    operations.
    Justification:
      Consuming 2GB of memory while performing a merge on a large
      working copy is bad.

  * r15251
    Prevent crash when more than 50 options passed to a command line program.
    Justification:
      Crashes bad!
    Votes:
      +1: maxb

  * r15290 
    Hooks bugfix: if lock already exists and --force not passed, then
    don't call 'pre-(un)lock'.
    Justification:
      'pre'-hooks shouldn't be called when we *know* the filesystem is
      going to disallow the action.  This results in multiple hook
      calls for no good reason as the user re-attempts the action.
