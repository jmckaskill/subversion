This file tracks the status of releases in the 1.3.x line.

See "Stabilizing and maintaining releases" in trunk/www/hacking.html for
details on how release lines and voting work, what kinds of bugs can
delay a release, etc.

Status of 1.3.1:
================

Candidate changes:

  * r17333 and associated test case (copied from trunk)
    Fix issue #2306: modification of "svn:needs-lock" should adjust
    the native file system's read-only attribute within a WC.
    Branch: 1.3.x-r17333
    Justification:
      Backport of a change to trunk which resolves buggy behavior on
      (at least) Windows and Mac OS X, behavior which is inconsistent
      with Linux.
    Notes:
      dlr does not have a Windows development environment, and thus
      cannot adequately test this change.  Additional testing is
      especially important given the heavy amount of modification
      which was necessary when backporting the change from trunk.

  * r17829, r17831
    Fix issue # 1456: Subversion RedHat RPMs have bad interaction with NFS
    server/client.  This was easily accomplished by just making a package
    change to set the -rpath correctly during package building.
    Justification:
      Prevents spurious NFS and AUTOMOUNT messages in log files.

  * r17910
    Fix the ability to link libsvn_swig_py on Solaris 10 when
    compiling with GCC 3.4.2.
    Justification:
      Allows successful builds of the Python bindings in a relatively
      common situation on Solaris via a minor tweak to our build
      machinery which restores its behavior from Subversion 1.2.3 and
      earlier.  The new behavior is required only for Cygwin, and this
      change makes that (conditionally) so.

  * r18114
    In mailer.py:
    Fix bug: named substitutions gathered from defaults.for_repos were being
    ignored for sections which contained a specific for_repos option.

  * r18144, r18037, r18127 (only tools/dev/stress.pl)
    Add support for BDB-4.4 and automatic recovery of wedged databases.
    Justification:
      See above about automatic recovery of wedged databases.

  * r18146
    Don't block waiting for background jobs of hook scripts.

Approved changes:

  * r18078
    The svn:date property should be set at the end of a commit, while it's
    being finalized, not just at the beginning.
    Justification:
      Can result in out of order svn:date revprops with fsfs.  Simple fix.

  * r18127 (only build/win32/svn.rc)
    Fix copyright dates shown in Subversion Windows binaries.
    Justification:
      Up to and including 1.3.0, those dates were still 2000-2004...
