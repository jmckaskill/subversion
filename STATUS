Candidate changes for 1.5.1:
============================

 * r31313
   Make all ra layers return a consistent error when a path is not
   found in the repository.
   Notes:
     Small change, but API consistency is always a good thing.
     Does not merge cleanly!
   Question:
     Does r32056, nominated below, fix these test failures?
   Votes:
     +1: lgo, cmpilato
     -0: markphip (serf tests fail on OSX), epg (failure confirmed)

 * r31425, r31722, r32071
   Support the 'http-library' option when Subversion was configured
   with the '--enable-runtime-module-search' option.
   Notes:
     r32071 isn't required, but minimizes the difference against trunk.
   Votes:
     +1: arfrever

 * r30632, r30749, r30750, r31757, r31769, r31817
   Fix issue #3174, 'Merge algorithm chokes on subtrees needing special
   attention that have been renamed'.
   Justification:
     File merges that encounter this problem break, the fix is fairly simple,
     and directory merges already have the equivalent fix in 1.5.0.
   Notes:
     r31817 is the core fix for the issue, the other revision relate to
     a new test and some subsequent tweaks for to it.  r30749 conflicts
     trivally in the merge_tests.py test list. r30750 reverts an accidental
     change in r30749.

 * r31875
   Fix 'svn log --xml' against pre-1.2 servers.
   Votes:
     +1: hwright, arfrever

 * r31786
   Fix the Ruby bindings test failures: Normalize compared value.

     +1: kou

 * r30607, r30628, r30812, r30929, r30935, r30961, r30961, r31033,
   r31137, r31575, r31594, r31601, r31769, r31900, r31926, r31927
   Fix issue #3067: subtrees that don't exist at the start or end of a merge
   range shouldn't break the merge.
   Justification:
     This fixes a serious bug in which common merge use cases fail with an
     error.  We have already encountered this in our own repository.
     See http://subversion.tigris.org/issues/show_bug.cgi?id=3067#desc5
     onward for the tortured history and explanation of this problem.
   Notes:
     r31594, r31601, r31900, r31927 are the core fixes for this issue.

     r30628 some format only changes that are needed to avoid conflicts.

     r30607, r30812, r30929, r30935, r31575, r31769, r31926 add/tweak/expand
     merge_tests.py coverage of this issue.  Note that r31769 is also
     nominated in the issue #3174 group as it applies to both issues (and may
     already be backported).

     r30961, r30967, r31033, and r31137 are code and documentation improvements
     to some merge.c helper functions, needed to avoid conflicts.

 * r32017, r32029
   Support Berkeley DB 4.7.
   Justification:
     Failure to provide this patch will not prevent folks from compiling
     against Berkeley DB 4.7.  It just means that when they do, they will
     silently lose support for Berkeley DB's rather important logging
     subsystem.

 * r32056
   Fix ra_serf bug that has a potential to cause vague errors when
   location-segments report is run against non-existent node, exhibited
   at trunk@31900 via merge_tests failures.
   Votes:
     +1: kameshj

 * r31658, r31659
   Fix a remaining bug with issue #2825, Handle --depth option for 'merge'
   operations in terms of both content and mergeinfo.
   Justification:
     An inoperative merge to a directory at --depth files should set
     non-inheritable mergeinfo on the merge target and 'normal' mergeinfo
     on any of the target's file children.  Without this fix the file
     children get no mergeinfo set/updated.  This is a fairly minor bug, but
     it is inconsistent with the way we currently handle inoperative merges
     in every other situation (i.e. we still set mergeinfo - see issue #2883).
   Notes:
     r31659 is dependent on the r31059 (issue #3157) group.

 * r32080
   Add missing sentinel to call to apr_pstrcat(). Fixes crashes seen
   by TortoiseSVN users.

=================

 * r31059, r31060, r31061, r31075, r31151, r31391, r31398, and r31482
   Fix issue #3157, Merging a change from a path's natural history
   creates self-referential mergeinfo
   Notes:
     r31075, r31151, and r31482 are the core fixes for the issue, r31391 is a
     follow-up to r31075 that fixes a comment typo, the other revisions are a
     new test for the issue and a few minor follow-ups to that test.  The
     addition of the new merge test in r31059 and the removal of
     an XFail in the test list in r31075 trivally conflicts because several
     other new merge tests are not backported yet.  r31482 conflicts in the
     comment for merge.c's filter_natural_history_from_mergeinfo, again this
     is fairly trivial to resolve.
   Votes:
     +1: pburba, kfogel, cmpilato
     +1: markphip (all except r31391, r31398, and r31482)

 * r31300, r31301, r31312
   Fix issue #3199, subtree merges broken when required ranges don't
   intersect with merge target.
   Justification:
     A bit of an edge case, but when it is encountered merge silently
     fails to do the correct merge but sets mergeinfo as if it did.
   Notes:
     r31300 is a test for this issue, r31301 fixes the core problem where
     the part of the merge was skipped, and r31312 fixes a problem with
     merge notification.

 * r31833
   svndumpfilter: Don't match prefixes to partial path components. Fixes 
   #desc4 of issue #1853.
   Notes:
     Was originally committed to the svnpatch-diff branch in r31831, and
     then merged to trunk as r31833.

     +1 (non-binding): stylesen

 * r32023
   Follow up (r31884) to fix issue #2242 which checks for a NULL username.
   Notes:
     Was merged in r32050, but was subsequently reverted in r32085 because it
     hadn't had sufficient votes and because the merge in r32050 was incomplete;
     see <http://svn.haxx.se/dev/archive-2008-07/0274.shtml>.
