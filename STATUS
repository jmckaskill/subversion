details on how release lines and voting work, what kinds of bugs can
delay a release, etc.

Status of 1.4.0:
================

Candidate changes:

  * r20648
    Fix broken API contract and numerous error leaks in svn_config_ensure().
    Justification:
      API states a different behavior than the implementation
      provides.  Initialization of JavaHL's native library will fail
      if the invoker's $HOME isn't accessible.

  * r20652
    JavaHL: Fix handling of the Subversion client's config dir during
    native library init and API manipulation.
    Justification:
      Ensuring the config dir exists shouldn't happen during library
      init, but instead when using the SVNClient API.  Changes to the
      config dir should trigger svn_config_ensure().
    Note:
      Depends on r20648.

  * r20686
    Stop overwriting our dependencies' autoconf stuff when we run
    autogen.sh.  (Also, fix "Apache 2.0" -> "Apache 2.x".)
    Justification:
      There is no point in doing so, and it can cause headaches if our 
      deps don't support the same version of autoconf as we do.

  * r20701, r20703
    Add 'neon' dependencies to svnsync, ra-local-test, and svn-push,
    working around libtool bug.
    Justification:
      Needed to successfully run tests if compiling against an installed Neon,
      and there are old Subversion libraries in the same directory as Neon.
    Branch:
      rs=http://svn.collab.net/repos/svn
      svn merge -r20702:HEAD $rs/branches/1.4.x-r20701
      # In case of svnmerge-integrated property conflict (inevitable unless
      # nothing else has been merged since the merge branch was created),
      # revert just the svnmerge-integrated property:
      svn ps svnmerge-integrated `svn pg -rbase svnmerge-integrated` .
      svn resolved .
      # and re-record the merge:
      svnmerge merge -M -F -r 20701,20703

  * r20715, r20717
    Fix some more global pool destruction ordering bugs.
    Justification:
      Fixes known issues with svnserve and bdb 4.4, fairly simple changes.
