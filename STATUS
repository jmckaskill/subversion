Status of 1.7.6:

Candidate changes:
==================

 * r1307177
   Move mod_dontdothat to install-tools.
   Justification:
     Undo compatibility break of 'make install' in 1.7.3.
   Votes:
     +1: danielsh, gstein

 * r1306275, and too many other revisions to list here
   New diff support code for added/deleted files and directories.
   Fixes issue #4153, "svn log --diff" on moved file gives "not found",
   and other problems.
   Justification:
     The current code (introduced in 1.7.x in the r1207351 backport commit)
     produces inconsistent paths in diff output (see
     http://svn.haxx.se/dev/archive-2012-03/0385.shtml), and it also breaks
     with the paradigm that the target of an editor drive may never have more
     than one path component (which according to cmpilato is an API violation).
   Notes:
     Please read the branch and related trunk log messages for detailed notes
     about these changes.
   Branch:
     ^/subversion/branches/1.7.x-issue4153
   Votes:
     +1: stsp

 * ^/subversion/branches/1.7.x-performance
   Use the working copy status walker as a first filter to find committable
   nodes.
   Justification:
     Huge performance boost. Especially on NFS.
   Notes:
     Backports the status walker framework. Many other parts are backportable
     too, but this branch delivers the plumbing.
   Votes:
     +0: rhuijben (I would like to see some test results before backporting)

 * r1341060
   Sort output of 'svn import'
   Notes: Needs a backport branch, noted here for completeness.
   Votes:
     +0: stsp (pending a proper conflict-free backport)

 * r1362508
   Avoid errors when users run 'svnlook changed', 'svnlook
   dirs-changed', or 'svnlook diff' on r0.  Though the output from
   those requests will always be empty, there's nothing inherently
   wrong with the requests themselves.
   Justification:
     Resolves complaint made by user(s).
   Votes:
     +1: cmpilato

 * r1365549, r1365554, r1365556
   Resolve regression where 'svn revert --depth files' only operates on the
   directory
   Justification:
     Simple regression fix.
   Branch: ^/subversion/branches/1.7.x-r1365554
   Notes:
     Trivial patch in r1365554; the other patches are for adding and updating
     a regression test.
   Votes:
     +1: rhuijben, philip

 * r1367498
   Make FSFS revision files independent of APR hash order.
   Justification:
     Make 'svnadmin load', and other commits,  produce reproducible revision
     files.
   Votes:
     +1: philip
     
Veto-blocked changes:
=====================

Approved changes:
=================

 * r1354876, r1354907, r1355340
   Allow non-existing but valid canonical absolute paths to pass through
   svn_dirent_get_absolute().
   Justification:
     Resolves a few user reported problems.
   Notes:
     r1354907 undoes r1354876, and r1355340 fixes a return problem, so
     it is easiest to review them as a single patch.
   Votes:
     +1: rhuijben, cmpilato, philip

 * r1361007, r1361019
   Don't record references to files in the system temp directory from
   workqueue operations from the merge code.
   Justification:
     Removes cases where a ^C can break your workqueue, because the
     diff code removes the files referenced from the workqueue in its
     pool cleanup.
   Branch: ^/subversion/branches/1.7.x-r1361007
   Notes:
     Requires a branch because the merge code has been reworked for 1.8.
   Votes:
     +1: rhuijben, cmpilato, philip

 * r1361341
   Avoid checking for working copies above the current working copy from
   svn_wc__acquire_write_lock() to avoid checking for .svn/wc.db in
   directories where we might not have read permission.
   Justification:
     Resolves a problem reported on the CollabNet Subversion forum.
   Branch: ^/subversion/branches/1.7.x-r1361341
   Notes:
     Requires a backport branch because we renamed svn_wc__db_kind_dir to
     svn_kind_dir for 1.8.
   Votes:
     +1: rhuijben, cmpilato, philip
