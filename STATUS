This file tracks the status of releases in the 1.6.x line.

See "Stabilizing and maintaining releases" in trunk/www/hacking.html for
details on how release lines and voting work, what kinds of bugs can
delay a release, etc.

Status of 1.6.2:
================

Candidate changes:

 * r36450, r36452, r37470, r37479, 37538
   Improve BASH completion.
   Votes:
     +1: arfrever

 * r37478, r37543, r37544, r37545, r37547
   Support using `svnversion` on files and improve some messages printed by
   `svnversion`.
   Justification:
     Some messages printed by `svnversion` are inconsistent and sometimes
     incorrect:
     $ svnversion /usr
     exported
     $ svnversion /bin/ls
     '/bin/ls' not versioned, and not exported
     $ svnversion VERSIONED_FILE
     'VERSIONED_FILE' not versioned, and not exported
     $ svnversion /nonexistent
     subversion/libsvn_wc/questions.c:90: (apr_err=2)
     svn: '/nonexistent' does not exist
     ^^^
     Messages with these revisions backported:
     $ svnversion /usr
     Unversioned directory
     $ svnversion /bin/ls
     Unversioned file
     $ svnversion VERSIONED_FILE
     NUMBER
     $ svnversion /nonexistent
     '/nonexistent' doesn't exist
   Votes:
     +1: arfrever
     -0: rhuijben, cmpilato (Introduces new features and changes output)

 * r37491, r37593
   Another merge performance improvement: Reduce contacts with server when
   a subtree with mergeinfo has non-inheritable mergeinfo and the subtree's
   immediate children have no explicit mergeinfo.
   Justification:
     If you hit this use case and the and the subtree in question has a *lot*
     of immediate children without mergeinfo then this change will avoid
     needless round trips for *each* of those children.
   Notes:
     There is a call to svn_uri_basename() in
     inherit_implicit_mereginfo_form_parent() that must be changed to
     svn_path_basename() since the former is new for 1.7.
     r37491 is the fix, r37593 is a typo fix.
   Votes:
     +1: pburba, rhuijben
     -0: gstein (code bloat)

Approved changes:
=================

 * r36178
   External merge-tool improvements.
   Justification:
     Makes automated merging easier, and also fixes a bug where a file
     which should be marked conflicted was considered successfully merged
     because the tool's exit status was not properly evaluated.
   Notes:
     The bug is only triggered when using an external merge tool with the
     --accept=launch option. I don't think we need to hold 1.6.0 on this.
   Votes:
     +1: stsp (I'd say it's a fix for a feature we already support (merge
               under control of external non-interactive tool), albeit
               the feature is currently so buggy that you can't use it.)
     +1: arfrever, cmpilato
     -0: hwright (there are merge conflicts.  they aren't big, but they are
                  non-trivial enough that I'd like to see a backport branch)

 * 37607
   Revert a behavioral change introduced in Subversion 1.6.0 that has proven
   confusing for users and difficult for GUI clients to deal with, namely
   that 'svn add' with a restricted depth no longer adds the targets reached
   by that depth with a depth=infinity setting of their own.
   Justification:
     Folks hated the change we're reverting here.
   Notes:
     Did I mention the whole hatred bit?
