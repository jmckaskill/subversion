This file tracks the status of releases in the 1.1.x line.

See "Stabilizing and maintaining releases" in trunk/HACKING for
details on how release lines and voting work, what kinds of bugs can
delay a release, etc.

Status of 1.1.3:
================

Candidate changes:

  * r12075, r12448
    Add pre-0.14 dumpfile compatability.
    Justification: Some very old clients were recently spotted in
    the wild.  And: Dumpfile compatibility is always good.
    Notes: These look good to me, but are complex enough that I'm not
      comfortable +1'ing without testing on an old dumpfile, and I
      haven't done that yet.  -kfogel

      (r12075 only) +1: ghudson
      -0: bliss (because the patch is non-trivial and there is only a
                 single known pre-0.14 user)
      +0: kfogel

  * r11050
    Add install dependencies for libsvn_fs and libsvn_fs_base.
    Justification:
      Allows users to install JavaHL separately, without needing to
      compile and install the base subversion package.  Without this
      fix, JavaHL installation crashes in that case.

  * r12483
    Fix the error message if the version of SWIG is wrong.
    Justification:
      It's confusing when you have 1.3.24 and it tells you that
      you need 1.3.19 or newer...

  * r12144, r12485
    Adds type caching to the perl bindings.  Otherwise mostly
    adds a code cleanup.
    Branch: 1.1.x-r12144
    Justificaton:
      Makes the perl bindings build with r12397 which we merged
      already.

Approved changes (further review is welcome, but not required):

Status of 1.1.4:
================

Candidate changes:

  * r12489
    Fix a confusing error message.  Issue #2174
    Justification:
      Users have no clue what to do about it not being locked and usually 
      if it's "not locked" it's a programmer error.  User errors will be
      probably that the dir is missing...
    Notes: This is under 1.1.4 so we don't include it in 1.1.3 which will
      be done to fix some small issues with 1.1.2.  Don't want to break
      translations.
