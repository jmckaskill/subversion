This file tracks the status of releases in the 1.6.x line.

See "Stabilizing and maintaining releases" in trunk/www/hacking.html for
details on how release lines and voting work, what kinds of bugs can
delay a release, etc.

Status of 1.6.8:
================

Candidate changes:

 * r878078, r878088, r878102, r878196
   Make KWallet window attached to terminal window.
   Justification:
     Without this change, KWallet window can appear behind terminal window
     and is left after killing terminal.
   Votes:
     +1: arfrever
     -0: peters, stsp (without r878196) (code is ugly and Linux-specific -
                                            would getenv("WINDOWID") work
                                            instead?)

 * r878216, r878341, r878343, r876862, r877203, r877595, r877665, r877597, r878269,
   r878321, r878399, r878423, r878426
   Fix issue #3432 'Merge can record mergeinfo from natural history gaps'
   Justification:
     Gaps in merge sources can lead to the creation of invalid mergeinfo
     or the removal of valid mergeinfo.
   Notes:     
     The fix itself in r878399 is relatively simple, but recent refactoring
     of the merge code on trunk makes it look a lot worse than it is.
     Unless otherwise noted, all of the following are nominated simply to
     avoid a conflict nightmare:
     r878216, r878341, r878343 - New test and test tweaks for the issue.
     r876862 - Comment changes only.
     r877203 - Scope reduction of a pool.
     r877595 - Minor bug fix and some refactoring.
     r877665 - Comment changes only.
     r877597 - Merge code refactoring.
     r878269 - Pool use cleanup, no functional change.
     r878321 - More merge code refactoring.
     r878423 - Variable rename to avoid shadowing a previous local.
     r878426 - Remove an unused variable.

 * r876032, r876104, r878447, r878910, r878911, r878916
   Several fixes to the Win32 exception handler. This change also makes it
   available on Windows Vista and 7 where it was previously blocked by a
   version check.
   Justification:
     This exception handler is a valuable debugging tool for users who don't
     have development tools installed. (Most users on Windows).
   Notes:
     Most of these revisions cancel out each other. The real changes are in
     r878447 (removing version check) and r878910,r878916 (fixing formatting
     specifier). It's probably easier to review the combined patch than the
     individual revisions.
   Branch:
     ^/subversion/branches/1.6.x-r38836.
   Votes:
     +1: rhuijben
     +0: pburba - I don't have a Vista or Win7 box to try this out on, but it
         works fine on my XP box.
     +0: lgo - code reviewed and looks good, but I don't have access to a
         Windows machine.

 * r879766
   Fix issue #3498: Subversion password stores freeze Eclipse
   Justification:
     All subclipse users are in great need of this.
   Branch:
     Resolves a minor conflict in libsvn_auth_gnome_keyring/gnome_keyring.c
     where the code changed was refactored on trunk.

 * r879902, r879916
   Disables file synchronization mutexes in fsfs on Windows. These mutexes
   were added to make POSIX systems lock files that were in use by other
   threads in the same process.
   
   Windows implements per filehandle locking, so it doesn't need these
   locks. We usually see the opposite problem in Subversion on Windows.
   Justification:
     This gives a measurable performance boost (5% decrease in running time
     on running the testsuite in parallel mode (on trunk). The difference
     will be bigger when measured on a real subversion server like one
     running apache or svnserve.
   Votes:
     +1: rhuijben

 * r880552
   Try to enable TCP keep-alives in svnserve.
   Justification:
     ra_svn clients do this, too. It should not do any harm.
     Is likely to fix hanging svnserve processes which still linger
     blocking on reads from sockets after days of inactivity on the
     connection, a problem seen and reported by MPlayer developers in #svn.

 * r892050, 892085
   Fix a reintegrate bug which can occur when the merge source has mergeinfo
   that explicitly describes common history with the reintegrate target.
   Justification:
     Reintegrate merges may not work if the reintegrate source has self-
     referential mergeinfo that is also self-referential to the reintegrate
     target.  This occured in our own repository, see
     http://svn.haxx.se/dev/archive-2009-12/0338.shtml.

 * r891672
   Fix issue #3552 - File external from URL cannot overwrite the existing
   versioned item
   Justification:
     This defect affects 'subversive' client users in 1.6.x.
   Notes:
     The backport branch exists in order to make the patch compatible with
     1.6.x tests. r876917 introduces 'switched' to wc status which is not 
     available in 1.6.x.
   Branch:
     ^/subversion/branches/1.6.x-r891672

 * r896522, r896547
   Fix segfault with 'svn resolve [mine-full | base | theirs-full]'.
   Justification:
     Easily reproducible segfault.
   Notes:
     r896522 is simply the addition of a new test to cover this 1.6.x-only
     bug.  r896547 is the actual fix, done on the backport branch.  Due to
     the ongoing wc-ng work, the fix could not be made on trunk.  For more
     info see http://svn.haxx.se/dev/archive-2010-01/0088.shtml.

Veto-blocked changes:

 * r877552, r877617, r877618, r877619, r877621
   Support using `svnversion` on files and improve some messages printed by
   `svnversion`.
   Justification:
     Some messages printed by `svnversion` are inconsistent and sometimes
     incorrect:
     $ svnversion /usr
     exported
     $ svnversion /bin/ls
     '/bin/ls' not versioned, and not exported
     $ svnversion VERSIONED_FILE
     'VERSIONED_FILE' not versioned, and not exported
     $ svnversion /nonexistent
     subversion/libsvn_wc/questions.c:90: (apr_err=2)
     svn: '/nonexistent' does not exist
     ^^^
     Messages with these revisions backported:
     $ svnversion /usr
     Unversioned directory
     $ svnversion /bin/ls
     Unversioned file
     $ svnversion VERSIONED_FILE
     NUMBER
     $ svnversion /nonexistent
     '/nonexistent' doesn't exist

     -1: rhuijben (Introduces new features and changes output;
                   I think it should be removed from STATUS)
