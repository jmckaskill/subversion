Candidate changes:
==================

 * r1293945, r1293972, r1293976, r1293998, r1294136, r1294236;
   r1294134, r1294147, r1294586
   Two interdependent changes:
   Fix issue #4121: copy followed by delete of unreadable child.
   Fix svn:// authz in Python tests.
   Justification:
     User resorted to patching the commit editor to work around this.
     Tests are broken.
   Notes:
     r1293945,r1293972,r1293976 are cosmetics.
     r1293998 is the fix.
     r1294136 is a test.
     r1294236 fixes an uninitialized variable.
   Notes:
     r1294134 extends a test to demonstrate its brokenness.
     r1294147 fixes said brokenness.
     r1294586 fixes r1294147 for Windows.

 * r1307177
   Move mod_dontdothat to install-tools.
   Justification:
     Undo compatibility break of 'make install' in 1.7.3.
   Votes:
     +1: danielsh, gstein

 * r1337441
   Fix XML namespace expansion in ra_serf
   Justification:
     Avoids segfaults caused by a malicious server sending unknown prefixes
     to ra_serf. (and corrects the semantics for a bonus win)
   Votes:
     +1: gstein, rhuijben

 * r1338810, r1339164
   Fix issue #4184 ("partial svnsync drops properties when converting
   copies to adds").
   Justification:
     Syncs that don't aren't synced at all.
   Notes:
     r1338810 taught the code to send properties for demoted copies.
     r1339164 fixed a theoretical use of uninitialized memory.
   Votes:
     +1: cmpilato
     +1: rhuijben (r1338810 only)

 * r1306275, and too many other revisions to list here
   New diff support code for added/deleted files and directories.
   Fixes issue #4153, "svn log --diff" on moved file gives "not found",
   and other problems.
   Justification:
     The current code (introduced in 1.7.x in the r1207351 backport commit)
     produces inconsistent paths in diff output (see
     http://svn.haxx.se/dev/archive-2012-03/0385.shtml), and it also breaks
     with the paradigm that the target of an editor drive may never have more
     than one path component (which according to cmpilato is an API violation).
   Notes:
     Please read the branch and related trunk log messages for detailed notes
     about these changes.
