================

Candidate changes:

  * r20648
    Fix broken API contract and numerous error leaks in svn_config_ensure().

      API states a different behavior than the implementation
      provides.  Initialization of JavaHL's native library will fail
      if the invoker's $HOME isn't accessible.
