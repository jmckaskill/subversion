Status of 1.0.7:
================

Candidate changes:

  * r9861
    fixes reentrancy problem for javahl binding. The pool for a call could be
    destroyed before the end of the call. This could crash the jvm
    Justification: javahl binding only fix to prevent a crash

  * r9883, r9905
    Fix for crash in javahl binding. If the first parameter of SVNClient.list
    is null, the jvm will crash. r9905 is the result of a scan of the binding
    code searching for this problem in all possible places.
    Justification: javahl binding only fix to prevent a crash

  * r8027
    Passing a Revision.DateSpec in javahl failed with 
    java.lang.NoSuchFieldError because java.util.Date.getTime() was 
    searched as a field when it is a method. 
    Justification: small change in javahl binding only

  * r10112, r10113, r10215, r10440, r10441, r10458, r10711, r10775
    Backport Perl bindings fixes from the 1.1.x branch
    Justification:
      Completeless and many leak fixes.  Note that FreeBSD ports has been using
      this diff and several people tested it.
    Notes:
      Merging directly would fail since there has been tree reoreganization.
