This file tracks the status of releases in the 1.5.x line.

See "Stabilizing and maintaining releases" in trunk/www/hacking.html for
details on how release lines and voting work, what kinds of bugs can
delay a release, etc.

Note: Because we anticipate a reasonable amount of new development
will still be required for Subversion 1.5, we are for the time being
applying the "somewhat looser voting system for areas that are not
core code" to the entire branch.

Status of 1.5.0:
================

Candidate changes:

 * r30335
   Allow NULL log messages in svn_ra_get_commit_editor2, for backwards
   compatibility with Subversion 1.4.
   Votes:
     +1: djames 

 * r30340, r30342, r30347
   Fix linking issues on cygwin by removing circular dependencies
   between libsvn_fs_{base,fs}/libsvn_fs and libsvn_ra_neon/libsvn_ra.
   (This also resolves linking issues with the ctypes python bindings.)

   Votes:
     +1: djames (r30340, r30342 only)

Approved changes:

 * r30278, r30279, r30285, r30299, r30304, r30319, r30320
   Update JavaHL bindings in light of r30215.
   Notes:
     This is dependent upon the r30215 group being merged.
   Votes:
     +1: markphip, hwright

 * r30215, r30221, r30225, r30226, r30230, r30243, r30286
   Simplify (UI-wise) yet vastly enhance the 'svn mergeinfo' subcommand and
   underlying APIs.
   Backport Branch:
     /branches/1.5.x-r30215
   Notes:
     If we approve this, we'll want to merge r30238 from the
     1.5.x-r30215 branch to trunk (to purge the APIs that never made
     it into 1.5).
   Votes:
     +1: cmpilato, kfogel

 * r30281, r30297
   Fix issue #3138: ra_serf: make get_locations and get_location_segments
   return an error when the target url isn't found in the repository.
   Votes:
     +1: lgo, kfogel

 * r30336
   Say "rNNNNN" in mergeinfo output, instead of "NNNNN".
   Votes:
     +1: kfogel, markphip

Status of 1.5.1:
================

Candidate changes:

 * r29852, r29857
    Add a test for 2-URL merges from foreign repositories and some subsequent
    tweaks.
    Notes:
      We've alread merged r29742-r29744, r29746 to 1.5.x which improves
      foreign repos merging, we might as well add this test too.
