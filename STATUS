Status of 1.0.6:
================

  * r8867, r8868, r8902
    Trivial performance fix for mod_authz_svn; cache the access file per
    connection instead of reloading it per request.
    Justification: Saves at least 2 loads of the access file per update, plus
    an additional number of times equal to the number of entries in the REPORT
    response.
    Notes: Similar code has been present in mod_dav_svn to cache an open
    filesystem per connection.

      -0: kfogel  (Reviewed the change; it's not *so* trivial, and I'm
                   not sure an optimization like this belongs in a
                   patch release.)

  * r9861
    fixes reentrancy problem for javahl binding. The pool for a call could be
    destroyed before the end of the call. This could crash the jvm
    Justification: javahl binding only fix to prevent a crash

  * r9883, r9905
    Fix for crash in javahl binding. If the first parameter of SVNClient.list
    is null, the jvm will crash. r9905 is the result of a scan of the binding
    code searching for this problem in all possible places.

  * r9816
    Fix a bug which prevents svnlook from creating its temporary directory
    inside a symlinked TMPDIR.

  * r8027
    Passing a Revision.DateSpec in javahl failed with 
    java.lang.NoSuchFieldError because java.util.Date.getTime() was 
    searched as a field when it is a method. 
    Justification: small change in javahl binding only
