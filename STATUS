This file tracks the status of releases in the 1.5.x line.

details on how release lines and voting work, what kinds of bugs can
delay a release, etc.


Candidate changes for 1.5.2:
============================

 * r31232, r31234, r31550, r31630
   Set of revisions required to make 1.5.x pass all tests over ra_serf.
   r31232 fixes blame test 16.
   r31234 fixes AN API issue, solves merge conflict with r31313
   r31550 fixes the 'check repo uuid on repo access' feature
   r31630 fixes copy test 22.
   Justification:
     With current HEAD of 1.5.x about 10 tests are failing, so that's quite a 
     regression. Changes nominated here touch code in ra_serf only and are low
     impact.
   Notes:
     A backport branch 1.5.x-ra_serf-backports has been created for this group,
     including the already approved r31313.

 * r32409
   Fix an incompatibility with BSD make, which was introduced in r24293.
   Justification:
     Trivial fix. Fixes out-of-tree build of the bindings on BSD.
     Might help downstream packagers for these systems.
   Votes:
     +1: stsp, arfrever
     +0: cmpilato

 * r32416, r32421
   Respect LDFLAGS in Perl bindings.
   Notes:
     Previously LDFLAGS were ignored (except for libsvn_swig_perl) even when
     the SWIG_LDFLAGS variable was set.
   Votes:
     +1: arfrever

 * r32417
   Fix issue #3255: client capabilities were not passed to start-commit
   Justification:
     Without this fix, start-commit cannot do early rejection of
     commits from clients that do not support mergeinfo.
   Votes:
     +1: kfogel, cmpilato

 * r32441
   Fix issue #3258: 8lock.t fails in non-English locale.
   Votes:
     +1: arfrever
     +0: hwright

 * r32442
   Respect LDFLAGS in SWIG bindings without the requirement of the exporting
   of the SWIG_LDFLAGS variable.
   Votes:
     +1: arfrever

 * r32444, r32445
   Fix issue #3237, relative externals may core dump.
   Votes:
     +1: blair, hwright

 * r32467, r32470
   Fix working copy corruption which happens when copying a file
   into a directory that exists in the entries file of its parent,
   but is not physically present on disk.
   Justification:
     If this happens, 'svn cleanup' won't help. There is no way to make
     the working copy usable again except manually editing the log.
   Branch:
     ^/branches/1.5.x-r32470
   Votes:
     +1: stsp, danielsh

 * r31725, r31837
   Canonicalise URIs which have an empty hostname part correctly.
   This fixes the crash described in #2116 ('svn log file:///'
   results in a failed assertion).
   Justification:
     Been fixed in trunk for a while, rediscovered in 1.5.1 by
     Toby Peterson <toby@apple.com>, see this thread:
     http://subversion.tigris.org/servlets/ReadMsg?list=dev&msgNo=141888
   Notes:
     r31837 fixes a bug introduced in r31725:
     Take an early out if path is "", to avoid accessing uninitialized
     memory later when we look at *(dst - 1).
   Votes:
     +1: stsp, danielsh

 * r32497, r32510
   Make libsvn_ra_neon initialization thread-safe: fix a race condition where
   if two neon requests are started at approximately at the same time, one
   call starts initializing and the other call thinks initialization is
   already completed. (r32510 is a minor code simplification)
   Justification:
     Fixes a reproducable crash when performing dav requests via multiple
     threads at the same time (reported as issue on the SharpSvn users list).
   Votes:
     +1: rhuijben

 * r32494, r32522, r32523
   Fix a bug where previous merges are incorrectly reversed leading to repeat
   merges and spurious conflicts.
   Notes:
     r32494 is just a doc string tweak that hopefully makes the real fix a
     easier to review, r32522 is a test for the bug, and r32523 is the real
     fix.  There is a trivial conflict on r32494 when adding the new merge
     test due to the fact that some other new merge tests are not backported
     yet.
   Justification:
     Repeat merges and needless conflicts in the age of merge tracking are,
     to put it mildly, less than desirable, see
     http://subversion.tigris.org/servlets/ReadMsg?list=dev&msgNo=141832.

Approved changes:
=================

 * r31313
   Make all ra layers return a consistent error when a path is not
   found in the repository.
   Notes:
     Small change, but API consistency is always a good thing.
     Does not merge cleanly!
     
     A backport branch 1.5.x-ra_serf-backports has been created to see which 
     revisions are needed to fix the tests that fail after r31313 is
     backported. The group r31234 as nominated above is needed so I propose
     to merge r31313 from the branch iff the r31234 group is approved too.
   Question:
     Does r32056, nominated below, fix these test failures? No, unrelated.
   Votes:
     +1: lgo, cmpilato, jerenkrantz, arfrever
     -0: markphip (serf tests fail on OSX), epg (failure confirmed)
