Status of 1.4.0:
================

Candidate changes:
      
  * r19919
    Fix SVN_CONFIG_NICE to work with autoconf 2.60-dev CVS and prereleases,
    which clobber configure arguments in AC_INIT. 
    Justification:
      Developer convenience throughout the lifetime of 1.4.x.
      Note that affected versions are already packaged within Debian etch.
    Concerns:
      Adds a config.nice.old file that has no relevance to this fix.

  * r20040, r20255, r20256

  * r20041
    Get rid of requirement for another RPM package (chrpath) to build the
    Linux RPM packages.
    Justification:
      Using Fedora Core as an example, I figured out a better
      way to simplify build package requirements with patch instead of
      package.

  * r20248
    Improve usability of Svn::Core::Dirent in the SWIG/Ruby bindings
    by adding a method, Svn::Core::Dirent#have_props?.

  * r20522
    Make svn_client_list conform to our guidelines for libsvn_client APIs.
    Justification:
      We can only do it right once: the first time.

  * r20524 (excluding bindings portion of change)
    1.4.x API consistency fix: make svn_wc_transmit_text_deltas2() use a
    digest output parameter in the same way that all the other functions
    in our API do.
    Justification:
      API cleanliness, avoid confusing users, avoid needing to write
      bindings that deal with two different protocols for returning the
      same kind of value.
    Notes:
      The bindings part of the trunk change conflicts when merged to 1.4.x -
      simply revert that part. It is simply removal of code rendered
      unused by the change - since leaving the code in place has no adverse
      effects, it is not worth the effort of a merge branch.
    Votes:
      +1: maxb, rooneg

  * r20530
    More API cleanliness for svn_wc_transmit_text_deltas2() - move the output
    parameters first, as per our standards.

      +1: maxb


Approved changes:

  * r20225
    Additional documentation for Ruby bindings
    Justification:
      Documentation is always good and the revision only adds docs.
    Note:
      Depends on r20042 - merge conflicts unless this revision is not merged.
