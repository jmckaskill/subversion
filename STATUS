This file tracks the status of releases in the 1.6.x line.

See "Stabilizing and maintaining releases" in trunk/www/hacking.html for
details on how release lines and voting work, what kinds of bugs can
delay a release, etc.

Status of 1.6.0:
================

Candidate changes:

 * r35894
   Whitespace cleanup on *.
   Justification:
     If we decide to merge anything we should also merge the whitespace
     cleanup to help future merges. Otherwise it should be moved to 1.6.1.
   Votes:
     +1: rhuijben (not strictly for 1.6.0)
     
 * r35967
   Add support to build and use SQLite amalgamation version on Windows.
   This change implements the same behavior as *nix build system does.
   Votes:
     +1: rhuijben (not strictly for 1.6.0)
     
 * r35968,r35974
   Buffer overflow on ensuring a 0 byte string buffer
   Justification:
     This bug aborts our client if the OS catches it (bad) or overwrites
     arbitrary ram (worse). r35974 fixes the exact allocating behavior tested
     from the string tests.
   Votes:
