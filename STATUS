This file tracks the status of releases in the 1.5.x line.

See "Stabilizing and maintaining releases" in trunk/www/hacking.html for
details on how release lines and voting work, what kinds of bugs can
delay a release, etc.


Candidate changes for 1.5.7:
============================

 * r36106
   Resolves issue #3374, "svn cp --parents path URL encoding issues"
   For
     svn cp --parent ^/fö ^/dö/fö
   The --parents code checked and might creat^/d%C3%B6, while the file was
   copied to ^/dö as expected.
   Justification:
     Without this patch --parents is broken for utf8 characters in repos
     to repos copy and move operations.
   Votes:
     +1: rhuijben
     -0: gstein (encoding issues are tricky; I'd rather tell people to
                 upgrade to 1.6.0, rather than 1.5.6)

 * r36111
   On Windows don't retry deleting a file 100 times when this file is really
   not a file but just a directory.
   Justification:
     Makes removing unversioned directories much faster.
     (You can see the delay with: svn rm --force <unversioned-empty-directory>)
   Votes:
     +1: rhuijben
     -0: gstein (edge case performance fixes shouldn't be backported; if
                 the user wants the fix, they can upgrade to 1.6.0 rather
                 than 1.5.6)

 * r35930
   Adjust basic_tests.py 12 for compatability with Windows and Python 2.5+.
   Justification:
     The mode 'rw+' is invalid with Python 2.5+ on Windows.
   Votes:
     +1: rhuijben, pburba

 * r36159
   Fix proxying of LOCK and UNLOCK requests via WebDAV proxies.
   Justification:
     With the fix, each slave server tries to field the lock/unlock, resulting
     in competing ideas of what is and isn't locked.
   Votes:
     +1: cmpilato

 * r36256
   Fix potentially awful performance of --ignore-ancestry merges.
   Justification:
     A very simple change which avoids an unneeded walk of the entire merge
     target.  For large WCs the performance improvment can be dramatic.
     See http://svn.haxx.se/dev/archive-2009-03/0067.shtml.
   Notes:
     There is a minor conflict while merging, so use backport branch
     at http://svn.collab.net/repos/svn/branches/1.5.x-r36256.
   Votes:
     +1: pburba

  * r36613, r36615, r36631, r36641
    Avoid potential segfault when dealing with subtree mergeinfo.
    Justification:
      One user reported a segfault due to the way, prior to this change, that
      we set children_with_mergeinfo elements to NULL rather than removing
      the elements from the array, see
      http://svn.haxx.se/dev/archive-2009-03/0382.shtml.
    Notes:
      The fix itself is r36613, r36631, and r36641.  r36615 is a variable
      renaming change that is necessary to avoid a conflict.  r36613 doesn't
      merge cleanly due to text conflicts and the lack of SVN_ERR_ASSERT in
      1.5.x.  A backport branch can be found at
      http://svn.collab.net/repos/svn/branches/1.5.x-r36613.

 * r36730, r36766, r36775
   Fix issue #3383 'Foreign repository merge can add mergeinfo from the
   foreign repos'
   Justification:
     At best this mergeinfo refers to non-existent paths in the target's
     repos.  At worst the mergeinfo intersects with actual path/revisions
     in the merge target.  The latter might cause real problems, making it
     appear merges have been done that actually have not or vice-versa.
   Notes:
     r36775 is the fix, the other revisions are expansion of an existing
     merge test to cover this issue.  There are some minor conflicts, a
     backport branch can be found at
     http://svn.collab.net/repos/svn/branches/1.5.x-r36775.
   Votes:
     +1: pburba

 * r36783
    Dereference a pointer to a svn_revnum_t to check if it's a valid
    revision.
   Justification:
     Thorugh sheer luck it doesn't appear that this can cause any problems,
     see http://svn.haxx.se/dev/archive-2009-03/0746.shtml, but it is
     clearly wrong.
