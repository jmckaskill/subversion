This file tracks the status of releases in the 1.6.x line.

See "Stabilizing and maintaining releases" in trunk/www/hacking.html for
details on how release lines and voting work, what kinds of bugs can
delay a release, etc.

Status of 1.6.4:
================

Candidate changes:

 * r36720
   Fix building with Apache 2.4.
   Votes:
     +1: arfrever, stsp

 * r37478, r37543, r37544, r37545, r37547
   Support using `svnversion` on files and improve some messages printed by
   `svnversion`.
   Justification:
     Some messages printed by `svnversion` are inconsistent and sometimes
     incorrect:
     $ svnversion /usr
     exported
     $ svnversion /bin/ls
     '/bin/ls' not versioned, and not exported
     $ svnversion VERSIONED_FILE
     'VERSIONED_FILE' not versioned, and not exported
     $ svnversion /nonexistent
     subversion/libsvn_wc/questions.c:90: (apr_err=2)
     svn: '/nonexistent' does not exist
     ^^^
     Messages with these revisions backported:
     $ svnversion /usr
     Unversioned directory
     $ svnversion /bin/ls
     Unversioned file
     $ svnversion VERSIONED_FILE
     NUMBER
     $ svnversion /nonexistent
     '/nonexistent' doesn't exist
   Votes:
     +1: arfrever
     -0: rhuijben, cmpilato (Introduces new features and changes output)

 * r37988
   Fix issue #3416, "Cannot add or commit 'dir/@file.txt'"
   Justification:
     Makes Subversion's behaviour regarding peg-revision parsing
     consistent with what The Book describes, and makes all subcommands
     properly deal with filenames starting with the '@' character.
   Branch:
     ^/branches/1.6.x-r37988
   Notes:
     Doesn't merge cleanly (two tree conflicts) from trunk, and needed an API
     change for backport.
   Votes:
     +1: stsp

 * r38004, r38014, r38028, r38122
   Make KWallet window attached to terminal window.
   Justification:
     Without this change, KWallet window can appear behind terminal window
     and is left after killing terminal.
   Votes:
     +1: arfrever
     -0: psamuelson, stsp (without r38122) (code is ugly and Linux-specific -
                                            would getenv("WINDOWID") work instead?)

 * r38166, r38168
   Fix issue #2580, svn+ssh SIGKILLs ssh processes
   Justification:
     Without this fix, svn+ssh:// does not play nicely with ssh
     connection pooling.
   Notes:
     See the issue for (an overwhelming amount of) details.
   Votes:
     +1: stsp

 * r38205
   Allow PLAIN and LOGIN mechanisms with SASL in svnserve.
   Justification:
     Allows authentication via LDAP to actually work, as advertised
     by The Book. If plaintext passwords are a concern, users can
     secure their network links by other means than TLS. We should
     not be making this decision for them.
   Notes:
     See http://svn.haxx.se/users/archive-2009-06/0536.shtml
   Votes:
     +1: stsp, rhuijben

 * r38222, r38223, r38261
   Fix GNOME Keyring with '--non-interactive' option.
   Justification:
     This was introduced in 1.6.x
   Branch:
     ^/branches/1.6.x-r38222
   Notes:
     Merging r38221:r38223 from trunk conflicts in 
     subversion/libsvn_auth_gnome_keyring/gnome_keyring.c.
     r38261 is also merged to the backport branch.
   Votes:
     +1: stylesen

 * r38279, r38311
   Fix issue #3442, on ext4 and GPFS filesystems with a fsfs
   repository.  If a crash occurs just after a commit is finished,
   then it's possible for the rev and current file to be fine but the
   revprops file to be empty.  Also fixes possible data loss since the
   old code clobbers the existing revprops file.
   Justification:
     Data loss is bad.
   Votes:
     +1: blair, hwright

  * r38290, r38293, r38294 
    Fix detection of Apache <2.0.56.
    AP_SERVER_MINORVERSION_NUMBER does not exist in earlier versions.
    But AP_SERVER_MINORVERSION (which is a string) does exist, so use that.
    Justification:
      Some people are stuck with older versions of things.
    Votes:
      +1: arfrever, stsp

  * r38458
    Make 'svnlook diff' show empty added or deleted files.
    Justification:
      If we don't print any output for empty added or deleted files,
      hook scripts relying on 'svnlook diff' to gather information about
      files affected by a revision can get confused.
      E.g. contrib/hook-scripts/enforcer is known to be affected,
      it cannot enforce rules on added empty files.
      Granted, this is not a very serious bug, but the fix is trivial.

      +1: stsp, rhuijben

  * r38521
    Fix Issue 3453: Building Subversion 1.6 requires GNU grep 2.5.
    Votes:
      +1: arfrever

 * r38417, r38424
   Fix issue #3443 'Obtaining implicit subtree mergeinfo hammers merge
   performance'
   Justification:
     If a merge target has "large" numbers (100's or 1000's) of subtrees
     with explicit mergeinfo, then this change can result in dramatic
     performance improvements, see example described in
     http://subversion.tigris.org/issues/show_bug.cgi?id=3443#desc1
   Notes:     
     Also see http://svn.haxx.se/dev/archive-2009-07/0149.shtml for
     discussion of this change.
