Status of 1.4.0:
================

Candidate changes:
      
  * r19919, r20632
    Fix SVN_CONFIG_NICE to work with autoconf 2.60-dev CVS and prereleases,
    which clobber configure arguments in AC_INIT. 
    Justification:
      Developer convenience throughout the lifetime of 1.4.x.
      Note that affected versions are already packaged within Debian etch.

  * r20600
    In mailer.py, allow mappings to apply to the diff_add_url,
    diff_copy_url, diff_delete_url and diff_modify_url parameters.
    Justification:
      The mailer.conf.example file says:
        It is typically used for computing from/to addresses, but can
        actually be used to remap values for any option in this
        file.
      This makes this statement truer (I haven't checked all the
      values that mailer.py accepts).
