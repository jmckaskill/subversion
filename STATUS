This file tracks the status of releases in the 1.7.x line.

See http://subversion.apache.org/docs/community-guide/releasing.html#release-stabilization
for details on how release lines and voting work, what kinds of bugs can
delay a release, etc.

Status of 1.7.0:

Candidate changes:
==================

 * r1146214, r1146381
   Handle NULL inputs when stringifying svn_checksum_t.
   Justification:
     Avoids segfaults.
   Votes:
     +1: danielsh
     -0: cmpilato, rhuijben, gstein (problem is with callers,
                                     not implementation)

 * r1146131 and followups
   Add svn_fs_verify() and implement rep-cache verification in FSFS using it.
   Branch:
     1.7.x-fs-verify
   Justification:
     Would be nice to extend verify already in 1.7.x.
   Notes:
     This does not include progress reporting, since as of this writing that
     is still a moving target.
   Votes:
     +0: danielsh
     +0: gstein (progress would be nice)

 * r1146832, r1146834
   Resolve several whitespace issues and a warning that is always visible
   for git-svn users.
   Justification:
     Trivial fix which suppresses warning.
   Notes:
     Binding change rules apply
   Votes:
     +0: rhuijben (I think it should be backported, but I can't test this)
     +0: gstein (likewise)

     
Approved changes:
=================

 * r1146219
   Fix the generated notification.
   Justification:
     Allow API users to more easily distinguish dump from verify.
   Votes:
     +1: danielsh
     +1: rhuijben, gstein (I think this should just go in 1.7.0)

 * r1146222
   Add a NULL check in an error path.
   Justification
     Avoids segfaults.
   Votes:
     +1: danielsh, gstein, stsp, rhuijben

 * r1146274
   Make svn_client_infoX() return proper results for tree conflicts. Without
   this patch the structure is just memcleared instead of properly set to
   uninitialized.
   Justification:
     Resolve regression and remove confusion by future callers.
   Votes:
     +1: rhuijben, gstein, stsp

 * r1146492, r1146555
   Add const to a couple members of svn_client_info2_t
   Justification:
     We don't want clients to think they can modify the underlying
     structures. We had similar problems with the svn_wc_status_t,
     and it makes it hard to rev APIs when clients may be monkeying
     with the data we pass along.
   Votes:
     +1: gstein, rhuijben, julianfoad, blair

 * r1146620
   Simple consistency for the 'svn_client_info2_t' structure; no functional
   change.  On the 'wc_info' member, remove 'struct' keyword, as we don't
   use it in any other similar situation.
   Notes:
     This change also marks the doc string for Doxygen, an 'obvious fix'.
   Votes:
     +1: julianfoad, rhuijben, gstein
     
 * r1146684
   Report the right wcroot in an 'svn upgrade' error message.
   Justification:
     Telling users they should upgrade the wrong directory is not
     what I call user friendly.
   Votes:
     +1: rhuijben, philip, gstein
