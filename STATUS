This file tracks the status of releases in the 1.6.x line.

See "Stabilizing and maintaining releases" in trunk/www/hacking.html for
details on how release lines and voting work, what kinds of bugs can
delay a release, etc.

Status of 1.6.3:
================

Candidate changes:

 * r37478, r37543, r37544, r37545, r37547
   Support using `svnversion` on files and improve some messages printed by
   `svnversion`.
   Justification:
     Some messages printed by `svnversion` are inconsistent and sometimes
     incorrect:
     $ svnversion /usr
     exported
     $ svnversion /bin/ls
     '/bin/ls' not versioned, and not exported
     $ svnversion VERSIONED_FILE
     'VERSIONED_FILE' not versioned, and not exported
     $ svnversion /nonexistent
     subversion/libsvn_wc/questions.c:90: (apr_err=2)
     svn: '/nonexistent' does not exist
     ^^^
     Messages with these revisions backported:
     $ svnversion /usr
     Unversioned directory
     $ svnversion /bin/ls
     Unversioned file
     $ svnversion VERSIONED_FILE
     NUMBER
     $ svnversion /nonexistent
     '/nonexistent' doesn't exist

 * r37491, r37593, r37618
   Another merge performance improvement: Reduce contacts with server when
   a subtree with mergeinfo has non-inheritable mergeinfo and the subtree's
   immediate children have no explicit mergeinfo.
   Justification:
     If you hit this use case and the and the subtree in question has a *lot*
     of immediate children without mergeinfo then this change will avoid
     needless round trips for *each* of those children.
   Notes:
     There is a call to svn_uri_basename() in
     inherit_implicit_mereginfo_form_parent() that must be changed to
     svn_path_basename() since the former is new for 1.7.
     r37491 is the fix, r37593 is a typo fix, r37618 is some code refactoring
     to address gstein's bloat concern.

     -0: gstein (code bloat)

 * r37622
   Work around a buffer overflow bug in some APR versions (recently
   fixed) by (ultimately) using apr_brigade_write() instead of
   apr_brigade_vprintf() to transmit large chunks of base64-encoded
   property data.
   Branch:
     ^/branches/1.6.x-r37622
   Justification:
     Failure case comes as a surprise, and basically blocks svnsync from
     moving on past a troublesome revision.  Upgrading APR to a fixed
     version is good, but not necessarily an option.  Our workaround is
     easier to deploy.
   Notes:
     Because of some refactoring work done on trunk, this isn't so
     much a backport as a reimplementation.  But merging the branch
     should do the trick.

     +1: cmpilato

 * r37627
   Fix for issue #3126 'svn mergeinfo shows too few or too many eligible
   revisions'
   Branch:
     ^/branches/1.6.x-r37627
   Justification:
     Without this change the svn mergeinfo subcommand gives incorrect
     and inconsistent results when encountering non-inheritable mergeinfo.
     See http://subversion.tigris.org/issues/show_bug.cgi?id=3126#desc5.
   Notes:
     r37627 revved the svn_mergeinfo_remove and svn_mergeinfo_intersect
     APIS.  So I created a backport branch that moves the declaration for
     these to subversion/include/private/svn_mergeinfo_private.h.

 * r37710
   Fix Issue 3413: Bindings fail to load FS modules with enabled run-time
   module search.
   Votes:
     +1: arfrever, stylesen

 * r37747, r37793
   Fix Issue 3414: DAV RA layers not properly handling update working copy
   dir to revision in which it didn't exist.
   Delay beginning the drive of the repos update editor until after some
   common error conditions have been tested for.  This helps provide
   more user-friendly error messaging for DAV clients.
   Notes:
     r37747 adds the test. r37793 is the actual fix.
   Justification:
     What part of "user" and "friendly" did you not catch?

     +1: cmpilato (r37793 only)
