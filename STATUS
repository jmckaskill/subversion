This file tracks the status of releases in the 1.3.x line.

See "Stabilizing and maintaining releases" in trunk/www/hacking.html for
details on how release lines and voting work, what kinds of bugs can
delay a release, etc.

Status of 1.3.0:
================

Candidate changes:

  * r16350
    Fix issue #1911, where svndumpfilter generated invalid dumpfiles
    when copies occurred and --drop-empty-revs and --renumber-revs
    were in use.
    Justification:
      Invalid dumpfiles are not nice.
    Votes:
      +1: cmpilato
      +0: dlr (concept, new to this area of the code)

  * r16372
    Fix shell test in Makefile breaking swig-py build, due to sometimes
    misidentifying a srcdir == objdir build as a srcdir != objdir build.
    Justification:
      Tiny fix, broken build bad.
    Votes:
      +1: maxb, djames

  * r16388, r16408
    Fix numerous bugs in the svn_fs_*berkeley*() APIs.
    Fix issue 2361 (recover on a FSFS repository errors if BDB not linked).
    Fix creation of BDB files in FSFS repositories by 'svnadmin recover',
      'svnadmin list-dblogs' and 'svnadmin list-unused-dblogs'.
    Justification:
      Not vital, but the creation of Berkeley DB files in a FSFS repository
      is a long standing bug which doesn't really give a good impression.
    Votes:
      +1: maxb

  * r16398, r16477
    Fix Issue #2172 (segfaults in the Python bindings caused by pool lifetime
    problems).
    Justification:
      Segfaults are bad. In 1.3.x, Python bindings users should not have to
      worry about memory pools.
    Notes:
      r16398 contains both bindings and core changes, which have different
      minimum voting requirements for backport. Thus, the votes are separated
      into two sections. r16477 contains exclusively bindings changes.
    Votes (core changes - parts of r16398):
      +1: dlr, lundblad
    Votes (bindings changes - parts of r16398 + all of r16477):
      +1: djames, dlr
      +1: maxb (r16477 only)

  * r16414, r16512, r16513
    Ensure that SWIG dependencies are correctly added to build-outputs.mk.
    Justification:
      Improves robustness of build system, fixes compile errors
      when user runs `make install-swig-py' without having run
      `make swig-py'.
    Votes:
      +1: djames, dlr

  * r16428, r16500
    Activate some Windows-specific behaviour on Cygwin too:
     - SVN_ASP_DOT_NET_HACK
     - Windows-specific augmented file:// URLs
    r16500 is a small followup.
    Justification:
      Cygwin is likely to be exposed to native-Windows-created WCs.
    Votes:
      +1: maxb, dlr
     
  * r16486
    Fiddle with the Perl bindings link command to avoid linking to installed,
    rather then build-tree libsvn_* libraries.
    Votes:
      +1: maxb, dlr

  * r16556
    Consolidated and better documented loading of the "svnjavahl-1"
    native library.
    Justification:
      Avoids a difference in handling of the loading of the native
      library between JavaHL's SVNClient and SVNAdmin classes.
    Votes:
      +1: dlr

  * r16562
    Detect files not to scan for includes by name, not by existance.
    Justification:
      Avoid a different code path being followed depending on whether the build
      tree is clean or not.
    Votes:
      +1: maxb

  * r16563
    Remove unnecessary complication in Makefile SWIG clean rules.
    Justification:
      Modernize the 'clean-swig' rules, because a future commit will add 
      'extraclean-swig' rules in the new style.
    Votes:
      +1: maxb

  * r16569
    Remove additional relics of pre-1.3.24 SWIG support.
    Votes:
      +1: maxb


Approved changes (further review is welcome, but not required):

  * r16470
    Move proxy_apr.swg from proxy/ to include/, leaving proxy/ to be a
    directory solely for build-time generated files.
    Justification:
      Keep branch close to trunk on this layout issue, because future build
      generator change will probably make use of this.
    Notes:
      Depends on r16414 and r16513.
