Candidate changes for 1.5.3:
============================

 * r32409
   Fix an incompatibility with BSD make, which was introduced in r24293.
   Justification:
     Trivial fix. Fixes out-of-tree build of the bindings on BSD.
     Might help downstream packagers for these systems.

     +1: stsp, arfrever
     +0: cmpilato

 * r32771
   po-update.sh: Search for messages in svn_fs_util.h.
   Justification:
     po-update.sh without this change doesn't add messages from svn_fs_util.h
     to .po files, so these messages are untranslated.
   Votes:
     +1: arfrever

 * r32968, r32975
   Fix bug which occurs when a merge adds explicit mergeinfo to a subtree that
   had no explicit mergeinfo prior to the merge.  This new mergeinfo could
   obstruct any mergeinfo the path previously inherited and the new path
   was not getting mergeinfo set that described the merge itself -- See 
   http://subversion.tigris.org/servlets/ReadMsg?listName=dev&msgNo=142460.
   Notes:
     r32968 is a new test for this problem and r32975 is the fix.
   Justification:
     Incorrect mergeinfo results when this bug is encountered and it has
     already been encountered in our own repository as described in the
     aforementioned thread.
   Votes:
     +1: pburba

 * r32977
   Fix the current early bailout of 'svn log' as exhibited during
   `svn log -gq -r31828 file:///usr/local/svn/subversion'.
   Justification:
     Server logic fault tolerance.  Code mo'-betta-ness.
   Votes:
     +1: cmpilato

 * r33136, r33137
   Fix issue #3285 - 'svn log -g' mistakes property change for
   mergeinfo removal.
   Notes:
     r33136 adds the regression test.  r33137 is the fix.
   Justification:
     This is a regression from 1.5.0.
   Votes:
     +1: cmpilato

 * r33173
   ra_serf: Fix the svn_ra_replay API, which got broken when svn_ra_replay_range
   was added. This API is not used anymore in svnsync. Bug was reported and fix 
   tested by durin42 over IRC.
   Notes:
     There's a small trailing whitespace conflict during merge.
   Justification:
     Regression introduced in 1.5.0.
