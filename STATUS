Status of 1.2.3:
================

Candidate changes:

   None.

Approved changes (further review is welcome, but not required):

  * r15683
    Include missing header in core.i.
    Justification:
      Bindings only. Silences compiler warnings when generating Python
      bindings on Windows.
    Votes:
      +1: brane
      +0: djames

  * r15705, r15742
    Fix a latent bug in FSFS's directory cache which caused fs-test 13
    to fail.
    Justification:
      Possible results in repository of dubious integrity if the cache
      was wrong in just the right ways.  (Unverified.)
    Notes:
    * In 1.2.x, there is no fs-test 13 for FSFS, so verification might
      have to be done hackily (perhaps by changing hardcoded "bdb" in 
      libsvn_fs_base/fs-test.c's delete () test to be "fsfs").
    * By itself, r15705 causes crashes in commit_tests 38 and the Ruby
      bindings test suite. r15742 fixes this problem.
    Votes:
      +1 (not r15742): brane
      +1: lundblad, cmpilato, kfogel
      +0: djames

  * r15737
    Fix crash in javahl with revision with no dates.
    Justification:
      Trival fix in javahl only.
    Votes:
      +1: pmayweg
      +0: lundblad, dlr

  * r15734
    Fix crash when calling svn_client_lock/_unlock with no targets.
    Justification:
      Trivial fix for corner case.
    Votes:
      +1: lundblad, kfogel, dlr
