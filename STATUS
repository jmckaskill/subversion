Status of 1.3.3:
================

Candidate changes:

 * r19915
   Require APR 0.9.7
   Justification:
     Older APR versions didn't return errors upon failed writes
     with buffered files: Potential repository corruption with FSFS.

  * r20041
    Get rid of requirement for another RPM package (chrpath) to build the
    Linux RPM packages.
    Justification:
      Using Fedora Core as an example, I figured out a better
      way to simplify build package requirements with patch instead of
      package.

 * r24073, r24126, r24128
   Branch: 1.3.x-issue-2751
   Fix issue #2751: Directory prop mods reverted in overlapping
     commits scenario.
   Justification:
     At the root of it, its very unexpected behavior that allows a commit
     to undo property changes without the committer being aware of it.
     But in the BDB case (at least), it has the horrific side-effect of
     setting the stage for a cycle in the representations table delta
     chain.  In case you're wondering, that's oh-so-bad.

Veto-blocked changes:

  * r17333 and associated test case (copied from trunk)
    Fix issue #2306: modification of "svn:needs-lock" should adjust
    the native file system's read-only attribute within a WC.
    Branch: 1.3.x-r17333
    Justification:
      Backport of a change to trunk which resolves buggy behavior on
      Windows, behavior which is inconsistent with Linux.
    Notes:
      dlr does not have a Windows development environment, and thus
      cannot adequately test this change.  Additional testing is
      especially important given the heavy amount of modification
      which was necessary when backporting the change from trunk.

    and r18037, r18127 (only tools/dev/stress.pl)
    Add support for BDB-4.4 and automatic recovery of wedged databases.

Approved changes:

  * r18254
    Fix parenthetisation in the SVN_BDB_VERSION_AT_LEAST macro.
    Justification:
      Avoids precedence bugs when used in boolean expressions.
    Note:
      Depends on r18144 et al. - unmergeable until those revs are merged.
