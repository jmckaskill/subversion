Candidate changes for 1.5.3:
============================

 * r32968, r32975
   Fix bug which occurs when a merge adds explicit mergeinfo to a subtree that
   had no explicit mergeinfo prior to the merge.  This new mergeinfo could
   obstruct any mergeinfo the path previously inherited and the new path
   was not getting mergeinfo set that described the merge itself -- See 
   http://subversion.tigris.org/servlets/ReadMsg?listName=dev&msgNo=142460.
   Notes:
     r32968 is a new test for this problem and r32975 is the fix.
   Justification:
     Incorrect mergeinfo results when this bug is encountered and it has
     already been encountered in our own repository as described in the
     aforementioned thread.

 * r32977
   Fix the current early bailout of 'svn log' as exhibited during
   `svn log -gq -r31828 file:///usr/local/svn/subversion'.
   Justification:
     Server logic fault tolerance.  Code mo'-betta-ness.

 * r29969, r33013, r33016, r33022, r33112
   Fix a merge bug and greatly improve merge performance in a common
   merge use case.
   Notes:
     r29969 is a small bit of merge code cleanup that has no functional
     effect but prevents a conflict when r33112 is merged. r33013, r33016,
     and r33022 are a new merge test and some tweaks to that test. r33112
     is the fix itself.
   Justification:
     The minor bug is described here,
     http://subversion.tigris.org/servlets/ReadMsg?list=dev&&msgNo=142849,
     but probably more important is the performance improvement. A while
     back glasser pointed out that the code to filter self-referential
     mergeinfo was a performance hog, see 
     http://svn.haxx.se/dev/archive-2008-02/0206.shtml, and made some
     suggestions to improve performance.  r33112 implements glasser's
     suggestions, which speeds up merge significantly in some cases,
     see http://subversion.tigris.org/servlets/ReadMsg?list=dev&msgNo=143030.

 * r30257, r33024, r33026
   Don't try to filter natural history from added mergeinfo during
   reverse merges.
   Notes:
     r30257 is the urelated removal of an unused private struct in merge.c,
     not required but avoids a conflict with r33024.  r33024 is a change to
     include more information in the merge command baton, it results in no
     functional change itself but r33026 relies on this new information.
     There's a single trailing whitespace conflict during merge of r33024.
     r33026 is the core change.
   Justification:
     A reverse merge should simply return mergeinfo to a previous
     representation -- see
     http://subversion.tigris.org/servlets/ReadMsg?listName=dev&msgNo=142777.
     This change also improves reverse merge performance as it eliminates
     some unnecessary communication with the repository.

Approved changes:
=================

 * r33464
   libsvn_subr: Use a new filename instead of retrying when opening a unique
   temporary file fails on Windows. This removes unneeded extra delays on
   naming collisions. (Not only on directories, but also on in-use files).
   Justification:
     Wait loops are evil. Especially if they are not usefull, like on naming
     unique files.
