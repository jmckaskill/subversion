This file tracks the status of releases in the 1.5.x line.

See "Stabilizing and maintaining releases" in trunk/www/hacking.html for
details on how release lines and voting work, what kinds of bugs can
delay a release, etc.

Note: Because we anticipate a reasonable amount of new development
will still be required for Subversion 1.5, we are for the time being
applying the "somewhat looser voting system for areas that are not
core code" to the entire branch.

Status of 1.5.0:
================

Candidate changes:

  * r29439
    Simplify (and optimise) parsing of the DAV response header in
    ra_neon capabilities detection.

  * r29797
    Fix sample VC6 build script.
    Justification:
      User-requested nomination (Masaru Tsuchiyama). I assume that the
      script is otherwise broken.

  * r29858, r29859, r29876
    Fix some bugs related to merges from foreign repositories,
    including bogus attempts at recording mergeinfo, and the creation of
    corrupt wcprops.
    Notes:
      r29859 isn't required, but minimizes the diff against trunk.
