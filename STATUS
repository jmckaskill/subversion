This file tracks the status of releases in the 1.4.x line.

details on how release lines and voting work, what kinds of bugs can
delay a release, etc.

Status of 1.4.0:
================

Candidate changes:
      
  * r19919
    Fix SVN_CONFIG_NICE to work with autoconf 2.60-dev CVS and prereleases,
    which clobber configure arguments in AC_INIT. 
    Justification:
      Developer convenience throughout the lifetime of 1.4.x.
      Note that affected versions are already packaged within Debian etch.
    Concerns:
      Adds a config.nice.old file that has no relevance to this fix.

  * r20562
    API: Use named, not anonymous, structs and enums in new-in-1.4 cases, for
    consistency with the majority of existing cases.
    Concerns:
      All this does is introduce extraneous symbols into the global namespace.
    Counter-concerns:
      The namespace 'pollution' is entirely benign, since it lies within the
      svn_* namespace which we already lay claim to, and we would never ever
      desire to create both a 'struct svn_foo_t' and a 'svn_foo_t' which were
      different.
    Benefits:
      Makes name of thing being declared be present at the start of the
      declaration, as is common with all other C constructs, rather than
      just at the end, which is less readable.

  * r20600
    In mailer.py, allow mappings to apply to the diff_add_url,
    diff_copy_url, diff_delete_url and diff_modify_url parameters.
    Justification:
      The mailer.conf.example file says:
        It is typically used for computing from/to addresses, but can
        actually be used to remap values for any option in this
        file.
      This makes this statement truer (I haven't checked all the
      values that mailer.py accepts).
