This file tracks the status of releases in the 1.5.x line.

See "Stabilizing and maintaining releases" in trunk/www/hacking.html for
details on how release lines and voting work, what kinds of bugs can
delay a release, etc.

Note: Because we anticipate a reasonable amount of new development
will still be required for Subversion 1.5, we are for the time being
applying the "somewhat looser voting system for areas that are not
core code" to the entire branch.

Status of 1.5.0:
================

Candidate changes:

  * r30009
    Fix WC breakage when receiving updates on non-schedule-normal files
    Votes
      +1: dionisos

  * r29858, r29859, r29876
    Fix some bugs related to merges from foreign repositories,
    including bogus attempts at recording mergeinfo, and the creation of
    corrupt wcprops.
    Notes:
      r29859 isn't required, but minimizes the diff against trunk.

 * r29939, r29942, r29986
   Add validation of SSL server certificates to ra_serf.
   Notes:
     Requires serf 0.2 (unreleased), code doesn't get built with older
     versions.
   Votes:
      +1: lgo
  
 * r30030
   Always pass --tag=CC / --tag=CXX option to libtool.
   Justification: Checking if libtool supports these options gives false
     results with libtool-2.2.
   Note: This removes support for libtool <1.5 (but a quick survey showed
     that nobody was using it, anyway.)

 * r29980
   Use in-tree libraries in check-swig-pl.
   Votes:
     +1: epg

 * r30050
   Don't assert on 'svn commit URL'
   Justification: Asserts are bad.  User reported problem.
