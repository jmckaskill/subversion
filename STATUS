This file tracks the status of releases in the 1.5.x line.

See "Stabilizing and maintaining releases" in trunk/www/hacking.html for
details on how release lines and voting work, what kinds of bugs can
delay a release, etc.


Candidate changes for 1.5.6:
============================

 * r34875
   Fix depth_tests.py 23 issues that sometimes occurs on Windows when a BDB
   repository is not unlocked fast enough to delete it in the testcycle.
   (Reported multiple times by Mark Phippard, Jens Peters and me as failure
   when testing subversion 1.5.x before release)
   Justification:
     Tests that often fail for the wrong reason, might hide real issues
     with our releases.

 * r34919, r34924
   Make svn client to use the 'LFS' capability of 'neon' to allow commits 
   of new file(post-compression) beyond > 2GB in size.
   Note that Neon currently doesn't support > 2GB on Windows, so this only
   fixes this issue on Linux, *BSD and probably MacOS.
   Justification:
     A simple cast limits our maximum upload file size on systems where neon 
     supports larger uploads.

 * r35297, r35367
   Allow svn_mergeinfo_parse() to tolerate unordered rangelists as input
   while still guaranteeing the mergeinfo it creates has sorted rangelists
   as required by all our rangelist manipulating APIs.
   Justification:
     Versions of svnmerge-migrate-history.py and
     svnmerge-migrate-history-remotely.py prior to r35358 could create
     mergeinfo in the repos with rangelists sorted in reverse order.
     Prior to r35297 this broke any subcommand which encountered this
     mergeinfo because svn_mergeinfo_parse returned a parsing error.
   Votes:
     +1: pburba, rhuijben

 * r35466, r35712, r35713
   Allow svn_mergeinfo_parse() to tolerate overlapping rangelists as input
   while still guaranteeing the mergeinfo it creates has no overlapping
   rangelists as required by all our rangelist manipulating APIs.
   r35713 fixes a possible range shrinkage introduced in r35466. (r35712 is
   a testcase for this issue).
   Justification:
     svnmerge-migrate-history.py and svnmerge-migrate-history-remotely.py
     can create mergeinfo with overlapping rangelists, which breaks any
     subcommand which encounters this mergeinfo because svn_mergeinfo_parse
     returns a parsing error.
    Note: Will conflict if r35297 group is not applied first.  Assuming
    r35297 is already merged, accept theirs-conflict on
    subversion\tests\libsvn_subr\mergeinfo-test.c to avoid a minor conflict.
    avoid a minor conflict.

     +1: rhuijben

 * r35516
   Prevent svnmerge-migrate-history.py from committing non-canonical
   mergeinfo.
   Justification:
     Make dead certain svnmerge-migrate-history.py can't create mergeinfo
     with overlapping or unordered rangelists.  Subversion <= 1.5.5 will
     error out if it tries to parse this mergeinfo, see issue #3302.

     +1: pburba, rhuijben

 * r35566
   Improve performance of log operation to < 1.5 servers by only creating
   a secondary ra session when it is really necessary.
   Justification:
     Makes "svn log" noticable faster over WAN connections to 1.4 servers.
   Notes:
     A backport branch is available on ^/branches/1.5.x-r35566
   Votes:
     +1: rhuijben
     
 * r35733
   Remove a gigantic performance penalty on using JavaHL on Windows compared
   to all other operating systems.
   Justification:
     Calling Windows 10 times slower than unix because we implemented things
     the wrong way is BAD.
   Votes:
     +1: rhuijben
     
 * r32448
   Copy properties of 'svn add'ed but uncommitted files.
   Justification:
     Makes sure that auto and normal props that are applied to a file actually
     get committed when a new file is renamed before this first commit.
     (Reported as AnkhSVN bug)
   Note:
     The second hunk in copy_tests.py (adding mergeinfo expectation) has
     been reverted on trunk, I suppose it should be reverted after merging.

Approved changes:
=================

 * r35143, r35145
   Make it impossible to add .svn (and children) to your working copy via 
     svn add --parents .svn/file
     svn mkdir --parents .svn/dir/dir
     svn cp --parents file .svn/dir/file
   Note: Small merge conflict in the tests lists of basic_tests.py.
   Justification:
     Failing to catch this breaks our administrative area handling.
