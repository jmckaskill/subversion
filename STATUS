Status of 1.0.3:
================

Candidate changes:

  * r8708
    Use warnings pragma on perl hook-scripts.
    Justification: Perl correctness issue.
    Votes:
       +1: sussman
       -1: breser (Doesn't error out properly on older versions and 
                   needs more discussion).

  * r8867, r8868, r8902
    Trivial performance fix for mod_authz_svn; cache the access file per
    connection instead of reloading it per request.
    Justification: Saves at least 2 loads of the access file per update, plus
    an additional number of times equal to the number of entries in the REPORT
    response.
    Notes: Similar code has been present in mod_dav_svn to cache an open
    filesystem per connection.

      +1: striker
      -0: kfogel  (Reviewed the change; it's not *so* trivial, and I'm
                   not sure an optimization like this belongs in a
                   patch release.)

  * r9003
    Include the path to the directory containing libsvn_swig_java in
    SWIG_JAVA_LINK to allow the SWIG Java bindings to actually build.
    Justification: It is not possible to build the SWIG Java bindings
    without this fix.
    Votes:
      +1: dlr, breser

  * r9315
    Change the formating codes used in svn_swig_pl_callback_thunk.
    Justification: The old ones weren't portable and caused problems on Win32.
    Votes:
      +1: breser
      +0: dionisos

  * r9439
    Update many references to neon 0.24.5.
    Justification: 0.24.4 has a security issue.  See
    http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CAN-2004-0179
    Votes:
      +1: blair, dlr

  * r9551
    Fix RPM build for Fedora and WBEL3/RHEL3.
    Justification: This fixes the RPM build to work without patching.
    Votes:
      +1: david

  * r9589
    Fix nasty pool usage problems in 'svnlook diff/changed/dirs-changed'.
    Justification: commit-email.pl uses 'svnlook diff', and 'svnlook
    diff' on, say, and large import, can get *really* nasty memory-wise.
    Votes:
      +1: cmpilato, dionisos

  * r9697
    Fix potential attack path in pre-commit-hook template.
    Justification: Don't offer templates we don't want to use ourselves.
    Votes:
      +1: dionisos, kfogel
