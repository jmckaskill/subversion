This file tracks the status of releases in the 1.6.x line.

See "Stabilizing and maintaining releases" in trunk/www/hacking.html for
details on how release lines and voting work, what kinds of bugs can
delay a release, etc.

Status of 1.6.15:
================

Candidate changes:

 * r879766
   Fix issue #3498: Subversion password stores freeze Eclipse
   Justification:
     All subclipse users are in great need of this.
   Branch:
     Resolves a minor conflict in libsvn_auth_gnome_keyring/gnome_keyring.c
     where the code changed was refactored on trunk.
     ^/subversion/branches/1.6.x-r39692
   Votes:
     +1: stylesen
     +0: julianfoad (reviewed, not tested)
     -0: rhuijben (needs more explanation: The not-interactive and no
                   callback code paths should be more similar if the code
                   works correctly. I think the not interactive code path
                   needs the same fix).

 * r878590, r878607, r878625, r878626, r878627
   In trunk we optimized the common case of 'find-and-replace with same uri'
   of proxied content thanks to issue 3445 "WebDAV proxy code munging user
   data".
   r878590 is just a change that adds FIXME marker to code comment. We take it
   to avoid spurious conflicts with other revisions.
   r878607 Special cases no-op find and replace.
   "r878625, r878626, r878627" are follow-up to r878607 and the other long 
   pending Master info leak to the clients.
   Justification:
     1. This group has the most common 'optimization' fix of *not* groking the
        proxied response to find and replace with same string.
     2. Fixes the master information leak via the Location header.
     3. Need this to be ported for the other defect to be ported
        without conflict.

     -0: julianfoad (seem to be multiple changes here for different reasons -
           at least issue '3445 and an optimization and an information leak;
           r878607 log msg says it fixes bugs but it's not clear what bugs;
           don't know how to tell whether justification 1 is significant;
           justifications don't seem to refer to issue #3445. Please can we
           separate these changes and clearly describe each one? And update
           the r878607 log msg.)

 * r916286, r917512
   Fixes failing commmits (with vague error messages) seen on client
   side for WebDAV proxy configurations such as the following (note
   the trailing slash at the end of '/svn/'):

      <Location /svn/>
         DAV svn
         SVNParentPath /repositories
         # Trailing slash on the master URI also can cause the confusion.
         SVNMasterURI http://master/svn/
         SVNAdvertiseV2Protocol Off
      </Location>

   Error message shows up like so:

      svn: Commit failed (details follow):
      svn: MKACTIVITY of '/svn/demujin/!svn/act/4b6d547c-018d-4e02-9d3f-2b28\
      3076cc06': Could not read status line: connection was closed by server\
       (http://localhost)

   Notes:
     Depends on the r878590 group for a conflict-free backport.
   Justification:
     Fixes failed commits.
   Votes:
     +1: kameshj

 * r917523
   If the configured slave url employes URI-unsafe characters
   (<space>, '?', '%'), proxying of commits fails and commit affects
   the slave repository directly.
   Notes:
     This backport depends on the r878590 and r916286 groups only for the
     conflict free port.  Alternatively, the back-port branch '1.6.x-r917523'
     attempts to represent a dependency-free version of the same change.
   Justification:
     With this commit we avoid accidental commit to the slave and hence 
     making it unusable as a proxy anymore.
   Branch:
     ^/subversion/branches/1.6.x-r917523
   Votes:
     +1: kameshj (with r878590 and r916286 groups)

 * r996383
   Add shorthands for 'svn --accept=%s' values.
   Justication:
     Require less typing to resolve conflicts.
   Votes:
     +1: danielsh

  * r991972
   Replace os.rename(src,dst) with shutil.move() while setting up authz files
   in the test suite.
   Notes:
     On most linux variants, os.rename(src,dst) will tolerate an existing
     dst, but Windows will not.  The change to use os.rename() was made in
     the backport of r991534.
   Justification:  
     With r991534 backported, we can no longer run the dav tests on Windows
     without this change.
   Branch:
     No branch is required, however r991972 was made in sandbox.py, which
     doesn't exist on 1.6.x.  A file merge from sandbox.py to main.py on
     the 1.6.x branch will cleanly apply the one line change, i.e.:     
     svn merge ^/subversion/trunk/subversion/tests/cmdline/svntest/sandbox.py
     subversion\tests\cmdline\svntest\main.py -c991972
   Votes:

 * r1036429
   Fix svnsync_tests 29 for BDB.
   Justification:
     Avoids an assert in the server.

Veto-blocked changes:
=====================

 * r877552, r877617, r877618, r877619, r877621
   Support using `svnversion` on files and improve some messages printed by
   `svnversion`.
   Justification:
     Some messages printed by `svnversion` are inconsistent and sometimes
     incorrect:
     $ svnversion /usr
     exported
     $ svnversion /bin/ls
     '/bin/ls' not versioned, and not exported
     $ svnversion VERSIONED_FILE
     'VERSIONED_FILE' not versioned, and not exported
     $ svnversion /nonexistent
     subversion/libsvn_wc/questions.c:90: (apr_err=2)
     svn: '/nonexistent' does not exist
     ^^^
     Messages with these revisions backported:
     $ svnversion /usr
     Unversioned directory
     $ svnversion /bin/ls
     Unversioned file
     $ svnversion VERSIONED_FILE
     NUMBER
     $ svnversion /nonexistent
     '/nonexistent' doesn't exist

     -1: rhuijben (Introduces new features and changes output;
                   I think it should be removed from STATUS)

 * r878078, r878088, r878102, r878196
   Make KWallet window attached to terminal window.
   Justification:
     Without this change, KWallet window can appear behind terminal window
     and is left after killing terminal.
   Votes:
     +1: arfrever
     -0: peters
     -1: rhuijben ("/proc/%ld/stat" is ugly and Linux-specific -
                   would just getenv("WINDOWID") work instead?)
     -1: stsp (I've removed the Linux-specific code from trunk in r1002144
               and r1002151, so trunk code only relies on getenv("WINDOWID").
               I would +1 a backport that also merges these revisions).

 * r921453, r927184, r927243
   Fix reopened issue #3020 'Reflect dropped/renumbered revisions in
   svn:mergeinfo data during svnadmin load'
   Justification:
     Prior to this fix, when loading a partial dump with mergeinfo, the
     resulting mergeinfo in the target repository could refer to non-existent
     revisions or revisions that have nothing to do with the merge source
     in the original repository.  The original fix for issue assumed that
     the dump stream was for a complete repository.
   Notes:
     r921453 and 927184 are tests, r927243 is the fix.
   Branch:
     ^/subversion/branches/1.6.x-issue3020
   Votes:
     +1: kameshj
     -1: pburba (There is a regression with this fix, see
         http://svn.haxx.se/dev/archive-2010-03/0716.shtml)

 * r933194
   Fix for issue #2753
   SVNListParentPath feature doesn't work when svn authz is used.
   Justification:
     This issue is waiting for resolution for more than 3 years.
   Notes:
     See discussion at http://svn.haxx.se/dev/archive-2010-04/0275.shtml
   Votes:
     -1: cmpilato (pending results of aforemented discussion)

 * r950445, 950468
   Fix for issue #2591 "'svnadmin hotcopy' does not replicate symlinks".
   Justification:
     This fix helps server administrators who has common files symlinked
     across their repositories and take frequent backups of their repos
     using svnadmin hotcopy.
   Notes:
     r950445 fixes the issue and r950468 is a test for this issue.
     In r967173 on trunk, svn_io_dir_walk()'s original functionality
     was restored, and svn_io_dir_walk2() introduced to also cover
     symlinks.
   Votes:
     +1: stylesen,
     -0: julianfoad (Tested and works fine, but changes semantics of
           svn_io_dir_walk() which we should not do in a back-port.
           Discussing on list.)
     -1: cmpilato (Changes semantics of svn_io_dir_walk()).
