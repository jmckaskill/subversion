This file tracks the status of releases in the 1.5.x line.

See "Stabilizing and maintaining releases" in trunk/www/hacking.html for
details on how release lines and voting work, what kinds of bugs can
delay a release, etc.

Note: Because we anticipate a reasonable amount of new development
will still be required for Subversion 1.5, we are for the time being
applying the "somewhat looser voting system for areas that are not
core code" to the entire branch.

Status of 1.5.0:
================

Candidate changes:

 * r29922
   Add a new SVNAllowBulkUpdates mod_dav_svn directive which toggles
   support for send-all style update REPORT responses (versus the
   original, and now ra_serf-employed, skelta-style ones).  This is useful
   for security-sensitive shops that want to track the GETs of each
   individual versioned file but can't mandate that ra_serf (which is
   still labeled as experimental anyway) be used.
   Notes:
     This depends on the r30086 grouping, else it opens up the opportunity
     for ra_neon switch operations to fail.

Approved changes:
 * r30145, r30185
   Start recording mergeinfo for inoperative merges.  As discussed here,
   http://subversion.tigris.org/servlets/ReadMsg?listName=dev&msgNo=136570,
   no-op merges now *do* record mergeinfo.  r30145 effectively reverts the
   code and tests changes involved with fixing (now non-)issue #2883.
   Notes: r30145 is the bulk of this change, r30185 is just some follow-on
     cleanup of some struct fields not longer required after r30145.

   When we backported r30162(which is in between r30145 and r30185) from /trunk
   we missed merging one change to merge_tests-19 i.e around line 2003
   of subversion/tests/cmdline/merge_tests.py(post merge of r30145 and r30185).
   This missing change causes merge_tests-19 to fail.
   To fix that we need to apply the following pseudo patch.

   -expected_status.tweak('A/B/lambda', status='!M')
   +expected_status.tweak('A/B/lambda', status='! ')
   
   Let me first merge r30145, r30185 and commit and apply the diff in the
   subsequent commit.
