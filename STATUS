This file tracks the status of releases in the 1.5.x line.

See "Stabilizing and maintaining releases" in trunk/www/hacking.html for
details on how release lines and voting work, what kinds of bugs can
delay a release, etc.

Note: Because we anticipate a reasonable amount of new development
will still be required for Subversion 1.5, we are for the time being
applying the "somewhat looser voting system for areas that are not
core code" to the entire branch.

Status of 1.5.0:
================

Candidate changes:

 * r29858, r29859, r29876
   Fix some bugs related to merges from foreign repositories,
   including bogus attempts at recording mergeinfo, and the creation of
   corrupt wcprops.
   Notes:
     r29859 isn't required, but minimizes the diff against trunk.
   Votes:
     +1: cmpilato

 * r29939, r29942, r29986
   Add validation of SSL server certificates to ra_serf.
   Notes:
     Requires serf 0.2 (unreleased), code doesn't get built with older
     versions.
   Votes:
      +1: lgo
  
 * r30030
   Always pass --tag=CC / --tag=CXX option to libtool.
   Justification: Checking if libtool supports these options gives false
     results with libtool-2.2.
   Note: This removes support for libtool <1.5 (but a quick survey showed
     that nobody was using it, anyway.)

 * r30074
   Follow-up to r30062: Rename resolved2 to resolve in Perl bindings.

      +1: arfrever, kfogel

 * r30061
   Tweak the svn_client_mergeinfo_get_merged() API to not claim to
   populate an svn_mergeinfo_t * structure, since it uses full URLs
   instead of absolute repository filesystem paths in that hash.
   Notes:
     If we don't backport this, we'll need to rev the API on trunk
     to enact this fix.
   Votes:
     +1: cmpilato, arfrever

 * r30070
   Remove the confusing conflict resolution support from 'svn
   resolved' (which still claimed it didn't do exactly that), 
   and add instead a new 'svn resolve' subcommand.  'svn resolved'
   is now deprecated in favor of 'svn resolve --accept working'.
