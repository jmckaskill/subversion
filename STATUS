delay a release, etc.

Status of 1.4.0:
================

Candidate changes:

  * r20932
    Fix --enable-dso in the face of our global bdb environment cache.
    Justification:
      Packagers like it when --enable-dso works.
    Votes:
      +1: rooneg

  * r20781
    autogen.sh: Purge *.pyc files from the build/ hierarchy after using the
    build generator, so that we do not ship them in tarballs.
    Justification:
      Shipping detritus like .pyc files in release tarballs is sloppy.
    Votes:
      +1: maxb
      -1: cmpilato (this is a very odd place to do this.  dist.sh, perhaps?)

  * r20190, r20250, r20444, r20826
    A few improvements to the Windows build system including a fix for the
    swig perl bindings.  They are grouped together to avoid conflicts.
    Justification:
      Most are very low impact build improvements, but without r20826 the
      Perl bindings won't build on Windows.
    Votes:
      +1: djh, brane (r20826 only from email),
          pburba (r20190, r20444, r20826)
      +0: dlr, pburba (r20250)

  * r20172, r20828
    Update the Windows build instructions.
    Justification:
      Documentation that more closely matches the reality is good.
    Votes:
      +1: djh, dlr

  * r20276
    Fixing an issue where non-recursive commit crashes/hangs svn (regression
    compared to 1.3).
    Justification:
      Medium impact on code, but regression compared to 1.3. Since TortoiseSVN
      uses -N exclusively I suspect this will impact the TSVN 1.4 release.
    Votes:
      +0: lgo

  * r20833, r20836 (depends on r20190 group above)
    Provide named, separate debug information files for clients building
    against Subversion libraries.
    Justification:
      Very low impact and silences hundreds of warnings about missing debug
      information when linking to Subversion libraries.
    Votes:
      +1: djh
      +0: dlr, cmpilato

  * r20883
    Fix an l10n encoding bug: correctly encode an error message showing
    invalid options passed to svn.
    Justification:
      Inability to display a correct error message due to an encoding issue
      is not good and confuses users using locales with many multibyte
      characters.  The change has low impact.
    Notes:
      An entry for CHANGES may be something like
      "fixed: a wrongly-encoded error message on invalid options for svn 
      (r20883)".
    Votes:
      +1: nori

  * r20885
    Clarify an error message for node replacement.
    Justification:
      A low-risk error message improvement.
    Votes:
      +1: nori, dlr
    
  * r20886 (depends on r20833 group above)
    Allow javahl to build with VC Express and fix its debug symbol files.
    Justification:
      Low impact and allows javahl to build on VC Express.
    Votes:
      +1: djh, dlr

  * r20926
    Add the help text for the new extensions added in 1.4.
    Justification:
      Help message improvement to provide users with enough explanations
      about what is available in 1.4.
    Votes:
      +1: nori
    
  * r20927
    Show locking notifications using local path style for the 'svn'
    command-line client.
    Justification:
      Consistent output with other notifications.
    Note:
      Not a blocker for 1.4.0.

      +1: dlr, jerenkrantz



Approved changes:

  * r20834, r20864
    Fix issue #2583: 'svn diff' shouldn't require write access
    to the working copy.
    Justification:
      Low impact change restoring previous behavior.
