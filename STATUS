This file tracks the status of releases in the 1.5.x line.

See "Stabilizing and maintaining releases" in trunk/www/hacking.html for
details on how release lines and voting work, what kinds of bugs can
delay a release, etc.


Candidate changes for 1.5.1:
============================


 * r31658, r31659
   Fix a remaining bug with issue #2825, Handle --depth option for 'merge'
   operations in terms of both content and mergeinfo.
   Justification:
     An inoperative merge to a directory at --depth files should set
     non-inheritable mergeinfo on the merge target and 'normal' mergeinfo
     on any of the target's file children.  Without this fix the file
     children get no mergeinfo set/updated.  This is a fairly minor bug, but
     it is inconsistent with the way we currently handle inoperative merges
     in every other situation (i.e. we still set mergeinfo - see issue #2883).

 * r31234, r31550, r31629, r31630
   Set of revisions required to make 1.5.x pass all tests over ra_serf.
   r31234 fixes AN API issue, solves merge conflict with r31313
   r31550 fixes the 'check repo uuid on repo access' feature
   r31630 fixes copy test 22.
   r31629 fixes blame test 16.
   Justification:
     With current HEAD of 1.5.x about 10 tests are failing, so that's quite a 
     regression. Changes nominated here touch code in ra_serf only and are low
     impact.
   Notes:
     A backport branch 1.5.x-ra_serf-backports has been created for this group,
     including the already approved r31313.

Approved changes:
=================


 * r31313
   Make all ra layers return a consistent error when a path is not
   found in the repository.
   Notes:
     Small change, but API consistency is always a good thing.
     Does not merge cleanly!
     
     A backport branch 1.5.x-ra_serf-backports has been created to see which 
     revisions are needed to fix the tests that fail after r31313 is
     backported. The group r31234 as nominated above is needed so I propose
     to merge r31313 from the branch iff the r31234 group is approved too.
   Question:
     Does r32056, nominated below, fix these test failures? No, unrelated.
   Votes:
     +1: lgo, cmpilato, jerenkrantz
     +0: arfrever (serf tests fail)
     -0: markphip (serf tests fail on OSX), epg (failure confirmed)
