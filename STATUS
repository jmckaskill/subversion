This file tracks the status of releases in the 1.7.x line.

for details on how release lines and voting work, what kinds of bugs can
delay a release, etc.

Status of 1.7.0:

Candidate changes:
==================

 * r1146131 and followups
   Add svn_fs_verify() and implement rep-cache verification in FSFS using it.
   Branch:
     1.7.x-fs-verify
   Justification:
     Would be nice to extend verify already in 1.7.x.
   Notes:
     This does not include progress reporting; that has been postponed to 1.8.
   Conflicts:
     On fs_fs.c.  Resolve with 'theirs-conflict'.
   Votes:
     +1: danielsh, rhuijben
     +0: gstein (progress would be nice) (without r1161164, r1161180)
     -0: cmpilato (For a function with this name, the implementation is far
         too anemic. I'd prefer this be a private function in 1.7.x, leaving
         room for a future public API that really does full verification.)
         (without r1161164, r1161180)

 * r1147540, r1147541
   Remove unused variables in build system.
   Justification:
     Backporting of future changes will be easier.
   Votes:
     +1: arfrever
     -0: stsp (we can backport these when we need to)

 * r1154278, r1154379, r1154382
   Make 'svn ls' capable of listing Subversion 1.0-1.3 repositories using
   ra_serf.
   Justification:
     We promised not to break backwards compatibility and it is not nice
     that serf doesn't want to list the neon repository.
     (Check svn ls http://svn.webdav.org/repos/projects/neon/)
   Notes:
     r1154278 is a quick hack to detect old servers and to at least return
              some information.
     r1154379 is the real fix: fallback to a more compatible request.
     r1154382 makes sure the right result is used directly after falling
              back from svn_ra_serf__get_dir.
              (Most likely the problem is detected earlier than this function)
   Votes:
     +1: rhuijben, cmpilato

 * r1147299, r1162974, r1162995
   Fix issue #3867 'reintegrate merges create mergeinfo for non-existent
   paths' and issue #3961 'reintegrate merge of replaced source produces
   inaccurate mergeinfo'.
   Justification:
      Avoid potential confusion which can occur when a reintegrate merge
      sets mergeinfo (to describe the merge) which contains non-existent
      path-revs, other lines of history, and/or valid path-revs which were
      never merged.
   Notes:
     r1147299 and r1162995 is the addition and tweak of a test for
     issue #3961.  A test already existed for issue #3867 prior to branching
     1.7.x. r1162974 is the fix for both issues.
   Votes:
     +1: pburba, stsp

 * r1163243, r1163383
   Fix issue #3791 'svn mergeinfo shows natural history of added subtrees
   as eligible'.
   Justification:
     The 'svn mergeinfo [ -R | --depth [ files | immediates | infinity ] ]'
     subcommand gives incorrect answers in some use cases.
   Notes:
     r1163243 is a test for the issue, r1163383 is the fix.
   Votes:
     +1: pburba

 * r1163557
   Relax wcng consistency checks for file externals.
   Justification:
      Debug build claims wcng DB is inconsistent when it is OK.
   Branch:
     1.7.x-r1163557
   Votes:
     +1: philip

 * r1163792
   Follow-up to the issue #3975 fixes which were backported in r1161547.
   Justification:
      Some merge use cases fail due to the issue #3975 fixes.  However,
      this failure is legitimate in the sense that it should be expected
      and cleared, and the merge allowed to continue.  For details, see
      http://subversion.tigris.org/issues/show_bug.cgi?id=3975#desc6
   Notes:
     r1163792 simply catches and clears an error.  While this change needs
     to get into 1.7.0 (or the issue #3975 fixes need to come out), given
     the simplicity of the change I don't believe this constitutes a
     destabilizing change, so IMO does not require a restart of the soak
     for RC2.
   Votes:
     +1: pburba, stsp
     
 * r1163953
   Make the ra_serf delta editor report absent paths correctly.
   Justification:
     Some callers might assume that ra_serf follows the delta editor
     documentation even though our own code avoids and/or works around
     this problem in the update and diff editor in 1.7.x.
     (The other editors just ignore absent paths)
   Votes:
     +1: rhuijben
     
 * r1164386
   Avoid an expensive database operation in 'svn info'.
   Justification:
     Improves performance of 'svn info' on a single unmodified node by 20-30%, by
     moving an in most cases unneeded database call in the error handling.
   Votes:
     +1: rhuijben

 * r1164517, r1164580
   Fix issue #4003 ("'svn patch' seems unable to delete properties"). 
   Justification:
     This fixes a lack of consistency with how emptied file contents
     are handled.
   Notes:
     r1164517 adds the XFail regression test.
     r1164580 fixes the bug and expects test passage.
     Merge this with --accept=mine-conflict, and then manually remove
     the @XFail() line from the patch_tests.py:patch_deletes_prop()
     function.
   Votes:
     +1: cmpilato

 * r1164535, r1164554
   Fix issue #4004 ("'svn patch --reverse-diff' chokes on patches
   which add files with props").
   Justification:
     Prevents failure from a use-case that folks will naturally expect
     to work: "svn diff > PATCH && svn patch PATH --reverse-diff"
   Notes:
     r1164535 adds the XFail regression tests.
     r1164554 fixes the bug and expects test passage.
     Merge this with --accept=mine-conflict, and then manually remove
     the @XFail() line from the patch_tests.py:patch_reversed_add_with_props()
     function.
   Votes:
     +1: cmpilato

 * r1164426,r1164614
   Fix STMT_SELECT_NODE_CHILDREN_WALKER_INFO for correctness and speed.
   Justification:
     Recursive info and propset don't scale well with large working copies
     and may possibly act on the wrong nodes.
   Votes:
     +1: philip
     +0: peters (looks correct, but I didn't test, and while performance
                 should be better, I wonder if that's been tested at all)

 * r1164645
   Fix issue #3999 'svn merge with bad option or target segfaults'.
   Justification:
      Command line merge with too many targets and/or a bad option
      (no leading '-') results in a segfault without this fix.
   Votes:
     +1: pburba, philip

Veto-blocked changes:
=====================

Approved changes:
=================

 * r1161683, r1161721
   Fix issue #3976 "record-only merges which add new subtree mergeinfo don't
   record mergeinfo describing merge".
   Justification:
      Avoid repeat merges and possible spurious conflicts in merges subsequent
      to a --record-only merge which adds mergeinfo to a subtree which had no
      explicit mergeinfo prior to the merge.  Ok, that's a mouthful, to put it
      more succinctly: A --record-only merge of revision X should block future
      merges of revision X, but that wasn't happening here.
   Notes:
     r1161683 is a new test for this issue and r1161721 is the fix.
