This file tracks the status of releases in the 1.7.x line.

See http://subversion.apache.org/docs/community-guide/releasing.html#release-stabilization
for details on how release lines and voting work, what kinds of bugs can
delay a release, etc.

Status of 1.7.0:

Candidate changes:
==================

 * r1146131 and followups
   Add svn_fs_verify() and implement rep-cache verification in FSFS using it.
   Branch:
     1.7.x-fs-verify
   Justification:
     Would be nice to extend verify already in 1.7.x.
   Notes:
     This does not include progress reporting; that has been postponed to 1.8.
   Conflicts:
     On fs_fs.c.  Resolve with 'theirs-conflict'.
   Votes:
     +1: danielsh, rhuijben
     +0: gstein (progress would be nice) (without r1161164, r1161180)
     -0: cmpilato (For a function with this name, the implementation is far
         too anemic. I'd prefer this be a private function in 1.7.x, leaving
         room for a future public API that really does full verification.)
         (without r1161164, r1161180)

 * r1147540, r1147541
   Remove unused variables in build system.
   Justification:
     Backporting of future changes will be easier.
   Votes:
     +1: arfrever
     -0: stsp (we can backport these when we need to)
     -0: gstein

 * r1154278, r1154379, r1154382
   Make 'svn ls' capable of listing Subversion 1.0-1.3 repositories using
   ra_serf.
   Justification:
     We promised not to break backwards compatibility and it is not nice
     that serf doesn't want to list the neon repository.
     (Check svn ls http://svn.webdav.org/repos/projects/neon/)
   Notes:
     r1154278 is a quick hack to detect old servers and to at least return
              some information.
     r1154379 is the real fix: fallback to a more compatible request.
     r1154382 makes sure the right result is used directly after falling
              back from svn_ra_serf__get_dir.
              (Most likely the problem is detected earlier than this function)
   Votes:
     +1: rhuijben, cmpilato

 * r1147299, r1162974, r1162995
   Fix issue #3867 'reintegrate merges create mergeinfo for non-existent
   paths' and issue #3961 'reintegrate merge of replaced source produces
   inaccurate mergeinfo'.
   Justification:
      Avoid potential confusion which can occur when a reintegrate merge
      sets mergeinfo (to describe the merge) which contains non-existent
      path-revs, other lines of history, and/or valid path-revs which were
      never merged.
   Notes:
     r1147299 and r1162995 is the addition and tweak of a test for
     issue #3961.  A test already existed for issue #3867 prior to branching
     1.7.x. r1162974 is the fix for both issues.
   Votes:
     +1: pburba, stsp

 * r1163243, r1163383
   Fix issue #3791 'svn mergeinfo shows natural history of added subtrees
   as eligible'.
   Justification:
     The 'svn mergeinfo [ -R | --depth [ files | immediates | infinity ] ]'
     subcommand gives incorrect answers in some use cases.
   Notes:
     r1163243 is a test for the issue, r1163383 is the fix.
   Votes:
     +1: pburba

 * r1163557
   Relax wcng consistency checks for file externals.
   Justification:
      Debug build claims wcng DB is inconsistent when it is OK.
   Branch:
     1.7.x-r1163557
   Votes:
     +1: philip, rhuijben
     +0: neels (Much other code still dismally fails at file externals in
                unversioned dirs, e.g. 'status', 'commit'. This apparently
                only fixes maintainer-mode 'svn cleanup', IMHO low prio.)
    
 * r1164386
   Avoid an expensive database operation in 'svn info'.
   Justification:
     Improves performance of 'svn info' on a single unmodified node by 20-30%, by
     moving an in most cases unneeded database call in the error handling.
   Votes:
     +1: rhuijben
     +1: gstein (for 1.7.1)

 * r1164426, r1164614
   Fix STMT_SELECT_NODE_CHILDREN_WALKER_INFO for correctness and speed.
   Justification:
     Recursive info and propset don't scale well with large working copies
     and may possibly act on the wrong nodes.
     On a Linux machine with a Subversion trunk working copy on a local disk
     running 'svn info --depth infinity' shows it to be 2 or 3 times faster.
     On a larger working copy it's orders of magnitude faster.
   Votes:
     +1: philip
     +0: peters, gstein (looks correct, but I didn't test, and while
                         performance should be better, I wonder if that's
                         been tested at all)

 * r1167209
   Unbreak the tests after r1167208.

     +1: danielsh
