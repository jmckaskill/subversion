This file tracks the status of releases in the 1.6.x line.

See "Stabilizing and maintaining releases" in trunk/www/hacking.html for
details on how release lines and voting work, what kinds of bugs can
delay a release, etc.

Status of 1.6.0:
================

Candidate changes:
 
 * r36009
   Bump recommended and shipped SQLite version.
   Justification:
     I normally wouldn't care to nominate this, but since we are still in RC
     stage, we should go ahead and use the latest version of SQLite, if
     possible.
   Note:
     We can still ship the newer version without this change, but it makes
     sense to be recommending it in configure.

Status of 1.6.1:
================

Candidate changes:



Approved changes:
=================

 * r35945, r35948
   Mark fs-tests 18 as XFAIL.
   Justification:
     The test as been XFAIL for a long time, and returning it to be so isn't
     a problem.  A passing test suite is always Good.
