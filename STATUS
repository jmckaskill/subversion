================

Candidate changes:

 * r38053, r38055, r38057

 * r37478, r37543, r37544, r37545, r37547
   Support using `svnversion` on files and improve some messages printed by
   `svnversion`.
   Justification:
     Some messages printed by `svnversion` are inconsistent and sometimes
     incorrect:
     $ svnversion /usr
     exported
     $ svnversion /bin/ls
     '/bin/ls' not versioned, and not exported
     $ svnversion VERSIONED_FILE
     'VERSIONED_FILE' not versioned, and not exported
     $ svnversion /nonexistent
     subversion/libsvn_wc/questions.c:90: (apr_err=2)
     svn: '/nonexistent' does not exist
     ^^^
     Messages with these revisions backported:
     $ svnversion /usr
     Unversioned directory
     $ svnversion /bin/ls
     Unversioned file
     $ svnversion VERSIONED_FILE
     NUMBER
     $ svnversion /nonexistent
     '/nonexistent' doesn't exist
   Votes:

     -0: rhuijben, cmpilato (Introduces new features and changes output)

 * r37988
   Fix issue #3416, "Cannot add or commit 'dir/@file.txt'"
   Justification:
     Makes Subversion's behaviour regarding peg-revision parsing
     consistent with what The Book describes, and makes all subcommands
     properly deal with filenames starting with the '@' character.
   Notes:
     Doesn't merge cleanly (two tree conflicts), and needed an API
     change for backport. Backport branch is at ^/branches/1.6.x-r37988

 * r38021
   Fix links generated by the mod_dav_svn directory listing view so they
   accurately preserve any revision pegging requested by the user.
   Justification:
     The current code can present broken links, causing user confusion.
   Notes:
     Details are at http://subversion.tigris.org/issues/show_bug.cgi?id=3425

     +1: cmpilato, hwright

 * r38004, r38014, r38028
   Make KWallet window attached to terminal window.
   Justification:
     Without this change, KWallet window can appear behind terminal window
     and is left after killing terminal.
   Votes:
     +1: arfrever
     -0: psamuelson, stsp (code is ugly and Linux-specific -
                           would getenv("WINDOWID") work instead?)

 * r38068
   "File '...' already exists" when it obviously doesn't, during commit.
   Justification:
     This was introduced in 1.5.1 and propagated till now.
