Candidate changes for 1.5.5:
============================

 * r30257, r33024, r33026
   Don't try to filter natural history from added mergeinfo during
   reverse merges.
   Notes:
     r30257 is the urelated removal of an unused private struct in merge.c,
     not required but avoids a conflict with r33024.  r33024 is a change to
     include more information in the merge command baton, it results in no
     functional change itself but r33026 relies on this new information.
     There's a single trailing whitespace conflict during merge of r33024.
     r33026 is the core change.
   Justification:
     A reverse merge should simply return mergeinfo to a previous
     representation -- see
     http://subversion.tigris.org/servlets/ReadMsg?listName=dev&msgNo=142777.
     This change also improves reverse merge performance as it eliminates
     some unnecessary communication with the repository.

 * r33866
   Make ra_svn's Cyrus auth implementation (like the internal auth
   implementation) always prefer EXTERNAL to ANONYMOUS.  This prevents
   a weird regression vs 1.4 where svn+ssh:// would be treated as
   anonymous in some cases.
   Justification:
     Regression against 1.4 which can prevent users from even checking
     out repositories that they could check out with a 1.4 client.

 * r34082, r34096
   Fix issue #3275 by making WebDAV proxy slave servers pass through
   any GET or PROPFIND requests aimed at working resource URLs, even
   though those requests are read-only.  Why?  It does no good for the
   slave server to try to answer a read request aimed at an
   uncommitted transaction when said transaction's data lives solely
   on the master server.

 * r31311, r31314
   Fix bug whereby 'svn cp --parents URL/TO/EXISTING/FILE URL/TO/EXISTING/DIR'
   would seg fault.
   Notes:
     r31311 is the testcase and r31314 the fix. 
     Backport branch available as ^/branches/1.5.x-r31314.
   Justification:
     I just lost a night tracking this issue for an AnkhSVN user and I saw a
     few similar error reports earlier of users that couldn't reproduce.

 * r34385, r34393
   Fix broken merge when the merge target's natural history includes
   resurrections.
   Notes:
     r34385 is a new test.  r34393 is the fix.
   Justification:
     This problem was encountered 'in the wild' - see
     http://svn.haxx.se/dev/archive-2008-11/0618.shtml.  When encountered
     cherry harvest merges are completely broken.
