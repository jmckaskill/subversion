This file tracks the status of releases in the 1.4.x line.

See "Stabilizing and maintaining releases" in trunk/www/hacking.html for
details on how release lines and voting work, what kinds of bugs can
delay a release, etc.

Status of 1.4.0:
================

Candidate changes:

  * r20781
    autogen.sh: Purge *.pyc files from the build/ hierarchy after using the
    build generator, so that we do not ship them in tarballs.
    Justification:
      Shipping detritus like .pyc files in release tarballs is sloppy.
    Votes:
      +1: maxb
      -1: cmpilato (this is a very odd place to do this.  dist.sh, perhaps?)

  * r20833, r20836
    Provide named, separate debug information files for clients building
    against Subversion libraries.
    Justification:
      Very low impact and silences hundreds of warnings about missing debug
      information when linking to Subversion libraries.
    Votes:
      +1: djh
      +0: dlr, cmpilato

  * r20883
    Fix an l10n encoding bug: correctly encode an error message showing
    invalid options passed to svn.
    Justification:
      Inability to display a correct error message due to an encoding issue
      is not good and confuses users using locales with many multibyte
      characters.  The change has low impact.
    Notes:
      An entry for CHANGES may be something like
      "fixed: a wrongly-encoded error message on invalid options for svn 
      (r20883)".

  * r20886 (depends on r20833 group above)
    Allow javahl to build with VC Express and fix its debug symbol files.
    Justification:
      Low impact and allows javahl to build on VC Express.
    Votes:
      +1: djh, dlr

  * r21022
    Fix a syntax error that prevents some Inno Setup versions from
    using the debug Component of the install script.
    Justification:
      The installer should work on Windows.
    Votes:
      +1: dlr

  * r19937, r19940, 20975, 21034
    Bring svnsync and its tests up to what we've got in trunk.
    Justification:
      Minor tweaks, will improve ability to backport, and fixes svn:// tests.
    Votes:
      +1: rooneg, dlr

Approved changes:

  * r20971, r20967, r20965, r20964, r20961, r20960, r20958, r20956
    Tons of bugfixes, UI and usages improvements, error detection and
    reporting enhancements, and so on -- all in svnsync.
    Notes:
      Probably wanna grab the revisions which comprise sweeping code
      formatting changes, too, for merge and maintenance simplicity
      (r20963, r20962, r20959).  In fact, I think we basically want
      -r20955:20967 of the trunk, here, plus r20971.  That contains all
      -- and only -- these changes.
    Justification:
      Brand new code, admittedly getting a late start on testing outside
      of original dev-testing, but needing these improvements to prevent
      user confusion and embarrassment.
    Votes:
      +1: rooneg, cmpilato, dlr

  * r20996, r20999
    Fix --enable-dso in the face of global bdb environment caching.
    Justification:
      It would be nice if --enable-dso worked.  Fairly isolated change.
