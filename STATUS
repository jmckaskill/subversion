This file tracks the status of changes proposed for inclusion in 1.0.
Each candidate consists of a short identifying block (e.g., a revision
number, maybe an issue number), a brief description of the change, and
an at-most-one-line justification of why it should be in 1.0, followed
by the votes.  For example:

   * r98765 (issue #56789)
     Use an opaque type for svn_ra_get_ansible(), instead of void *.
     Justification: API stability
     See mailing list thread http://...
     Notes:
      jerenkrantz: This will break 1.0 compatibility.

A change needs three +1 votes from full committers (or partial committers
with access to the involved paths), and no vetoes, to go into the release.

Voting for a change doesn't just mean you approve of it in principle.
It means you have thoroughly reviewed the change, and find it correct
and as nondisruptive as possible.  When it is committed to the release
branch, the log message will include the names of all who voted for
it, as well as the original author and the person making the commit.
All of these people are considered equally answerable for bugs.

If you do cast a veto (i.e. -1), then please include your justification
for the veto in the Notes section.  An additional condition is the +1
'concept' vote, it means that you believe it to be 'right' conceptually
but have not confirmed it - this person may be a starting point if more
full +1 votes are needed for merging.

Thursday, Jan. 8th, 2004 is the deadline for candidate changes to be
voted on.  The sooner a change is listed, the more time people have to
review and vote.  (Obviously, emergency bugs can be reported, fixed,
and voted on at any time -- this deadline is for changes that we
already know about.)

   * r8016, r8019, r8028
     Copyright notice fixes.
     Justification: Why have copyright notices at all unless legally proper?
                    And, 1.0 *will* be out in 2004!
     Notes:
      rooneg: This is worth it just so diffing between the branch and the 
              trunk doesn't show differences for every damn file ;-)
     Votes:
      +1 (concept): jerenkrantz

   * r8053, r8054
     Constructor for svn_client_ctx_t
     Justification: Constructor helps with backward compatibility.
     Notes:
      jerenkrantz: For 1.0, we'll state that svn_client_ctx_t can only add
                   members, correct?  So, I'm not sure that adding the
                   constructor buys us a lot - it's not opaque.  *shrug*
      rooneg: Yeah, it doesn't force people to 'do the right thing', but it 
              makes it possible for them to do so, and since 'the right thing' 
              is clearly documented I think that's enough.  Plus, to make it 
              100% bulletproof we'd need accessor functions and an opaque 
              structure, and people didn't like that when I originally did it 
              that way.

   * Issue #999
     Anchor/target split may use NULL for target.
     Justification: API consistency
     Notes: Greg Hudson has said he has no intention of merging this
            into trunk unless it goes into 1.0 too, as doesn't want
            trunk to start out its new life with an API divergence.

   * r8003
     Remove svnserve -u client and server code.

   * Issue #1644
     apr_ and APR_ namespace symbols in Subversion
     Justification: API stability, non-interference w/ APR's namespace
     Notes: There is a patch from Julian Foad in the issue, but I
            think there may be more recent patches on dev@.  Voting
            is on a specific patch, so we need the latest patch...
     Votes:
      +1: jerenkrantz (per what was in IZ)


   * r8023, r8030, r8040

   * r8052, r8062  (issue #1660)
     Make svn_config__parse_file do charset conversion.
     Justification: Correctness, and went into 0.35.1.
     Notes:
      jerenkrantz: apr_conv_utf8_to_ucs2 *will* add the null term if you pass
                   in inbytes + 1

       +1 brane, jerenkrantz


   * r8021
     'svn revert' performance improvement (timestamp sleep once, not N times)
     Justification: it's small & safe, and it's an API change.

   * Issue #1668
     Rename 'svn_repos_authz_read_func_t' to 'svn_repos_authz_func_t'.
