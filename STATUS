Candidate changes for 1.5.5:

=================

 * r34091, r34094, r34244, r34256, r34306, r34331, r34742, r34814
   Various svn merge --reintegrate improvements.
   Branch:
     ^/branches/1.5.x-reintegrate-improvements
   Justification:
     Prior to these changes reintegrate would not work if the merge source
     had any subtree mergeinfo.  Since subtree mergeinfo is quite common,
     this meant reintegrate was largely unuseable.  With these changes
     reintegrate will work as long as the source's subtree mergeinfo and
     implicit mergeinfo reflect the fact that the reintegrate target was
     previously merged uniformly to the source for some contiguous revision
     range starting at the revision the source was branched from the target.
     These changes also improve the notoriously vague error message which
     occurred when reintegrate was thwarted by subtree mergeinfo.
   Notes:
     This code reintroduces a use of svn_ra_get_mergeinfo with
     include_descendants=TRUE, which can trigger the bug fixed by
     r34822 due to the size of the request response.  Consider r34822
     a prerequisite for this change group.

     +0: stsp (With my limited understanding of merge tracking it takes
               ages for me to review this properly.
               The change is fairly large. I've read all log messages and
               most of the diffs, including the history of the branch
               merged to trunk in r34091.
               I understand what the change is supposed to be doing,
               and from that point of view I can say that it actually
               does improve things a lot.)
