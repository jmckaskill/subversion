Status of 1.5.0:
================

Candidate changes:

 * r30573
   Fix issue in mod_dav_svn: add missing remove-props element(s) in update-
    report with send-all=False. No blocker, only used with ra_serf. But, 
    fixing this now will avoid that we have to provide a workaround in ra_serf
    later.
