This file tracks the status of releases in the 1.3.x line.

See "Stabilizing and maintaining releases" in trunk/www/hacking.html for
details on how release lines and voting work, what kinds of bugs can
delay a release, etc.

Status of 1.3.0:
================

Candidate changes:

  * r16344, r16347, r16358, r16375, r16494
    Provide more complete server-side information about working copy
    items which are out of date in the repository.
    Branch: status-from-repos-enhancements
    Justification:
      This info is extremely useful to Subversion clients; the first
      consumer is likely to be the "Synchronize" view of the Subclipse
      plug-in for the Eclipse IDE.

  * r16495
    Expose the "out of date" and URI fields now available from the
    svn_wc_status2_t data type to the JavaHL bindings via its Status
    class.
    Justification:
      Bindings should fully reflect the core Subversion API.
      Subclipse will start using these new APIs immediately.
    Notes:
      Depends on the status-from-repos-enhancements branch.

  * r16350
    Fix issue #1911, where svndumpfilter generated invalid dumpfiles
    when copies occurred and --drop-empty-revs and --renumber-revs
    were in use.
    Justification:
      Invalid dumpfiles are not nice.

      +1: cmpilato
      +0: dlr (concept, new to this area of the code)

  * r16372
    Fix shell test in Makefile breaking swig-py build, due to sometimes
    misidentifying a srcdir == objdir build as a srcdir != objdir build.
    Justification:
      Tiny fix, broken build bad.
    Votes:
      +1: maxb, djames

  * r16387
    Fix issue 2406 - Do not pass URL-encoded hostname to ra_svn tunnel agent.
    Justification:
      Small bug, easy fix, of value to Windows users of PuTTY.

      +1: maxb, lundblad

  * r16388, r16408
    Fix numerous bugs in the svn_fs_*berkeley*() APIs.
    Fix issue 2361 (recover on a FSFS repository errors if BDB not linked).
    Fix creation of BDB files in FSFS repositories by 'svnadmin recover',
      'svnadmin list-dblogs' and 'svnadmin list-unused-dblogs'.
    Justification:
      Not vital, but the creation of Berkeley DB files in a FSFS repository
      is a long standing bug which doesn't really give a good impression.

  * r16398
    Fix Issue #2172 (segfaults in the Python bindings caused by pool lifetime
    problems).
    Justification:
      Segfaults are bad. In 1.3.x, Python bindings users should not have to
      worry about memory pools.
    Votes:
      +1: djames, dlr

  * r16414
    Ensure that SWIG external runtime dependencies are correctly added
    to build-outputs.mk.
    Justification:
      Easily reviewable, might save someone some problems.
    Votes:
      +1: djames, dlr

  * r16428
    Activate some Windows-specific behaviour on Cygwin too:
     - SVN_ASP_DOT_NET_HACK
     - Windows-specific augmented file:// URLs
    Justification:
      Cygwin is likely to be exposed to native-Windows-created WCs.
    Votes:
      +1: maxb, dlr

  * r16437
    Remove needless "case" clause.
    Justification:
      The needless clause maybe cause a problem.
      For example:
        http://subversion.tigris.org/servlets/ReadMsg?list=dev&msgNo=106222

  * r16486
    Fiddle with the Perl bindings link command to avoid linking to installed,
    rather then build-tree libsvn_* libraries.
    Votes:
      +1: maxb
     

Approved changes (further review is welcome, but not required):

  * r16477
    Python bindings. Followup to r16398. Fix use-of-uninitialized-value bugs
    introduced by the half-migration of two functions to a new style.
    Justification:
      Use-of-uninitialized-value bugs are crash bugs.
    Votes:
      +1: maxb, djames, dlr

  * r16424
    Avoid gcc uninitialized warning.
    Justificiation:
      Should build without warnings.
