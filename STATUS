Status of 1.2.0:
================

Candidate changes:

  * r13983
    Correct valid warnings and bogus compilation errors specific to
    Jikes.
    Justification:
      Avoid warnings (and hard errors!), improve compile times.
    Votes:
      +1: dlr, kfogel

  * r14024
    Allow automated tests for the javahl bindings to be run before the
    bindings have been installed.
    Justification:
      Encourages hacking on the bindings, and improves user confidence.
    Votes:
      +1: dlr

  * r14041.
    Fix issue #2268 (svn update of xml-unsafe dir (from within) http error)
    Justification:
      Yet Another Path Escaping Bug
    Votes:
      +1: cmpilato, kfogel

  * r14063, r14066, r14068, r14079, r14121, r14124
    Branch: 1.2.x-r14063
    Fix FSFS locking problem.
    Justification:
      Issue #2265 can cause data loss.
    Notes:
      The backport branch removes the svn_fs_initialize() API, since
      that was contributing some disruption on trunk related to
      --enable-dso.  For practical purposes, the best-effort
      initialization of the common pool and mutex should be fine.

  * r14180
    Make the public locking API semantics for lock expiry match the internal
    storage and known concerned caller's semantics.
    Justification:
      Removes needless double-conversions, and solves the, "Does apr_time_t
      represent a moment in time or a span of time?" question.  Only affects
      APIs new to 1.2, so this is a chance to avoid some future baggage.
    Votes:
      +1: cmpilato

  * r14183
    Fix crash in the javahl binding, when using the Notify2 interface.
    Justification:
      Small javahl binding only fix to prevent crash of javavm.

Approved changes (further review is welcome, but not required):

  * r14126
    Tweaks to the lock comment handling, including getting rid of the
    editor invocation.
    Justification:
      The was concensus to remove the editor invocation.  It is easier
      to add back than to remove later.  Also, consistency.

      +1: lundblad, kfogel, ghudson

  * r14131
    In FSFS, don't auto-upgrade FS format number of legacy repositories.
    Justification: Might not have write access, might have wrong umask.

      +1: kfogel, ghudson, jszakmeister

  * r14169
    Make locking an out-of-date file fail over ra_svn.
    Justification:
      Trivial bug making locking less usaful over ra_svn.
    Votes:
      +1: lundblad, jszakmeister, cmpilato

  * r14081, r14098
    Fix Issue 1361: 'svn cat file -r BASE' contacts repository
    Justification:
      Fix for a bug that's existed for nearly 2 years.
    Notes:
      r14098 fixes a segfault case for cat'ing a nonexistant file, as well
      as adding a new test component for cat. -jszakmeister
    Votes:
      +1: jszakmeister, dionisos, cmpilato

  * r14118, r14137
    De-doxygenate svn_test.h.
    Justification:
      There is nothing remotely public about that file, time to stop
      saying otherwise.  We have never installed any binaries that in any
      way use that header.
