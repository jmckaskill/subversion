Status of 1.3.0:
================

Candidate changes:

  * r16350
    Fix issue #1911, where svndumpfilter generated invalid dumpfiles
    when copies occurred and --drop-empty-revs and --renumber-revs
    were in use.
    Justification:
      Invalid dumpfiles are not nice.
    Votes:
      +1: cmpilato, kfogel
      +0: dlr (concept, new to this area of the code)

  * r16388, r16408
    Fix numerous bugs in the svn_fs_*berkeley*() APIs.
    Fix issue 2361 (recover on a FSFS repository errors if BDB not linked).
    Fix creation of BDB files in FSFS repositories by 'svnadmin recover',
      'svnadmin list-dblogs' and 'svnadmin list-unused-dblogs'.
    Justification:
      Not vital, but the creation of Berkeley DB files in a FSFS repository
      is a long standing bug which doesn't really give a good impression.
    Votes:
      +1: maxb, kfogel

  * r16622
    Fix breakage of defining of SVN_SWIG_VERSION, by migrating its only user
    to use SWIG_VERSION, and fully removing relics of SVN_SWIG_VERSION.
    Justification:
      Caused Ruby bindings regression with swig 1.3.24.
    Votes:
      +1: maxb, djames

  * r16649, r16652, r16655, r16664
    Fix Python bindings wrapping of svn_opt_revision_t (and other union-
    having structures).
    Justification:
      Regression that, among other things, makes ViewCVS's 'svn_ra'
      module completely crippled.
    Votes:
      +1: cmpilato (r16649 only), dlr (r16649 and r16652 only), 
          kfogel (not r16655), lundblad (core changes only, not r16655),
          djames
