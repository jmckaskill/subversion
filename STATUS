Status of 1.2.3:
================

  * r15799, r15815
    Avoid lots of warnings when compiling with current version of APR.
    Justification:
      Simple fix, these warnings could obscure other more important ones.

Approved changes (further review is welcome, but not required):

  * r15419, r15420, r15422, r15448
    Add contrib/client-side/svn_apply_autoprops.py.
    Justification:
      It's a contrib script that is useful for users to easily apply
      their auto-props list to already checked in files across an
      entire working copy.  It would be good for it to be in an
      official release so that its more available.

  * r15732, r15796, r15802
    Add contrib/client-side/svn_export_empty_files.py.
    Justification:
      It's a contrib script.  Make it more accessible to svn users
      in the next svn release.
