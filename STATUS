Status of 1.4.0:
================

Candidate changes:

 * r19919
   Fix SVN_CONFIG_NICE to work with autoconf 2.60-dev CVS and prereleases,
   which clobber configure arguments in AC_INIT. 
   Justification:
     Developer convenience throughout the lifetime of 1.4.x.
     Note that affected versions are already packaged within Debian etch.
   Concerns:
     Adds a config.nice.old file that has no relevance to this fix.

  * r20125
    ra_serf: Be more tolerant when updating a WC file without a delta base.
    Justification:
      Certain operations (switch) will cause a WC to invalidate the version-url
      parameter and causes ra_serf to crash on a subsequent update to that file.

Approved changes:

  * r19924
    Deprecate svn_io_set_file_read_write_carefully and update the
    svn_io_set_file_read* functions to deal with perms and attributes
    correctly on unix and Win32.
    Justification:
      Needed for Win32 with APR > 0.9.x.

  * r20008
    Fix issue #2566: svnserve can cause broken WCs.
    Justification:
      Involves protocol change that's good to have in 1.4, allowing
      the client to behave correctly with authz and ra_svn.
