Candidate changes for 1.5.4:
============================

 * r33641, r33644
   Bug in which merging a path containing spaces would fail.  Generally
   URL-encode paths when appending them to URLs.
   Justification: silly bug, easy fix; similar to previously-ported fixes.

 * r32968, r32975
   Fix bug which occurs when a merge adds explicit mergeinfo to a subtree that
   had no explicit mergeinfo prior to the merge.  This new mergeinfo could
   obstruct any mergeinfo the path previously inherited and the new path
   was not getting mergeinfo set that described the merge itself -- See 
   http://subversion.tigris.org/servlets/ReadMsg?listName=dev&msgNo=142460.
   Notes:
     r32968 is a new test for this problem and r32975 is the fix.
   Justification:
     Incorrect mergeinfo results when this bug is encountered and it has
     already been encountered in our own repository as described in the
     aforementioned thread.

 * r30257, r33024, r33026
   Don't try to filter natural history from added mergeinfo during
   reverse merges.
   Notes:
     r30257 is the urelated removal of an unused private struct in merge.c,
     not required but avoids a conflict with r33024.  r33024 is a change to
     include more information in the merge command baton, it results in no
     functional change itself but r33026 relies on this new information.
     There's a single trailing whitespace conflict during merge of r33024.
     r33026 is the core change.
   Justification:
     A reverse merge should simply return mergeinfo to a previous
     representation -- see
     http://subversion.tigris.org/servlets/ReadMsg?listName=dev&msgNo=142777.
     This change also improves reverse merge performance as it eliminates
     some unnecessary communication with the repository.

 * r33693
   Fix merge bug introduced in the backport of the r29969, r32463, r33013,
   r33016, r33022, r33112 group in 1.5.3.
   Notes:
     There is a minor whitespace conflict in merge.c.
   Justification:
     This bug is a regression in 1.5.3, breaks mergeinfo aware merges when
     ecountered, and has already been seen a couple times in our own repos,
     see http://subversion.tigris.org/servlets/ReadMsg?list=dev&&msgNo=144187
     and http://subversion.tigris.org/issues/show_bug.cgi?id=3294#desc1.
