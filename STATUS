This file tracks the status of releases in the 1.1.x line.

See "Stabilizing and maintaining releases" in trunk/HACKING for
details on how release lines and voting work, what kinds of bugs can
delay a release, etc.

Status of 1.1.0:
================

Candidate changes:

  * r10242
    Fix a gcc compiler warning.
    Justification:
      Duh.  It's a compiler warning.
    Votes:
      +1: cmpilato, lundblad

  * r10604
    Cleanup some qsort-related stuff.
    Justification:
      Removes *4* redundant functions, but adds a new API.
    Votes:
      -0: ghudson (what's the point of putting code cleanups into 1.1?)
      +1: cmpilato

  * r10645
    Add new abbreviation 'Revision' for 'LastChangedRevision'.
    Justification:
      Tiny patch. Drastically eases conversion from CVS for repositories
      using $Revision$ and wanting to continue to use it for subversion -
      a simple propset, rather than text changes to every affected file.
      Patch has been filed in the issue for more than a year!
    Votes:
      +1: maxb, cmpilato

  * r10674
    Make ./configure behave nicer in the presence of old Apache.
    Justification:
      Tiny patch. If a user has an old apache on their system, but didn't ask
      us to use it, we shouldn't abort ./configure, just don't use it.
    Votes:
      +1: maxb

  * r10704
    Fix problem with javahl throwing IllegalArgumentException, with no error
    off the caller.
    Justification:
      Small javahl binding only patch.
    Votes:
      +1: pmayweg

  * r10322, r10531
    Update bash_completion to include new command line options in 1.1.x
    Justification:
      It'd be nice if our bash_completion was as current as possible.
    Notes:
      Remove the changes to add the version command in r10531, we don't have it
      in 1.1.x.  So only --force would be added to add from the r10531 rev.

      +1: breser

  * r10711
    Fix a non-portable temp file creation in SVN::Ra::Callback.  This
    triggers error on win32 ra_dav.
    Justification:
      Perl bindings only; win32 fixes.
    Votes:
      +1: clkao

  * r10438
    Replace references to APR_STATUS_IS_SUCCESS with a direct comparison
    either to zero or APR_SUCCESS.
    Justification:
      APR_STATUS_IS_SUCCESS is no longer defined in APR HEAD.
    Votes:
      +1: mbk, lundblad
      
  * r10722
    Display the targets printed for propedit in local style.
    Justification:
      Very tiny error in the output of the propedit command.
    Votes:
      +1: breser, lundblad

  * r10731
    Fix svn_path_dirname() so it returns canonical paths when passed a path
      with the last segment separated by multiple slashes.
    Justification:
      API contract violation.
    Votes:
      +1: breser
      -1: ghudson
          (http://www.contactor.se/~dast/svn/archive-2004-08/0754.shtml)

  * r10760
    Make "svn info" check for and refuse URL targets.
    Justification:
      Avoids assertion failure (the same one avoided by r10731).
    Votes:
      +1: ghudson

  * r10467, r10734, rXXXXX
    Detect and report lock-contention at recovery time.
    Justification:
      Improved user interface, low risk.
    Note:
      HEAD as of r10734 shows the new functions as "since 1.2.0" and the
      deprecated functions as "preserving the 1.1.0" API.  If these candidates
      are approved, then a new trunk revision, marked rXXXXX above, should
      also be applied to reflect that the changes were actually included
      in 1.1.0.
    Note: See discussion in
     http://www.contactor.se/~dast/svn/archive-2004-08/0804.shtml
    Votes:
      +1: mbk

  * r10752
    Remove packages/rpm/mandrake-*.
    Justification:
      Foolish to include something that has been maintainerless since
      before 1.0.0 in 1.1.x.
