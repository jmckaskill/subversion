This file tracks the status of releases in the 1.5.x line.

See "Stabilizing and maintaining releases" in trunk/www/hacking.html for
details on how release lines and voting work, what kinds of bugs can
delay a release, etc.

Note: Because we anticipate a reasonable amount of new development
will still be required for Subversion 1.5, we are for the the time
being applying the "somewhat looser voting system for areas that are
not core code" to the entire branch.

Status of 1.5.0:
================

Candidate changes:

 * r29127, r29135, r29136, r29138, r29163, r29164

   Votes:
     +1: kfogel (r29127, r29163, r29164)
     -1: glasser (The docstring for the new public API has some problems
         (mentioned on dev@); I'll be happy to remove this vote once that's 
         fixed.  [r29163 and r29164 might address these concerns. -kfogel])

 * r29155
   Allow packagers to build some parts of svn against installed svn libs.
   Votes:
     +1: epg

 * r29241
   Fix client/server deadlock in ra_svn gssapi.
   Votes:
     +1: epg

 * r29242
   Use "svn" for SASL service/application name rather than "svn" for
   one and "subversion" for the other.  INCOMPATIBLE: if this does not
   go into 1.5.0, it must be reverted on trunk.

     +1: epg

 * r29243
   Expand svnserve SASL documentation (depends on r29242).
