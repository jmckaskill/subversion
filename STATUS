Status of 1.1.4:
================

Candidate changes that seem to have become stalled
due to persistent lack of votes:

  * r12075, r12448
    Add pre-0.14 dumpfile compatability.
    Justification: Some very old clients were recently spotted in
    the wild.  And: Dumpfile compatibility is always good.
    Notes: These look good to me, but are complex enough that I'm not
      comfortable +1'ing without testing on an old dumpfile, and I
      haven't done that yet.  -kfogel

      -0: ringstrom (because the patch is non-trivial and there is only a
                     single known pre-0.14 user)
      -0: ghudson (not really comfortable having this code in the trunk,
                   much less 1.1; dumpfile compatibility in general
                   good, pre-0.14 compatibility not so important)

Candidate changes:

  * r13712
    Take out RPM "static build" feature that never actually worked.
    This feature was intended to build svnadmin statically such that when a
    package upgrade occured, the admin could dump the (old format) repository
    AFTER the upgrade.  Testing has revealed that the static compile with BDB
    never worked.
    Justification: Don't imply promises we can't keep.

  * r13715
    Teach swig-1.3.19-3 to co-exist with swig package that comes with Redhat.
    Justification: Less hassle for software developers because packages
      co-exist.

  * r13717
    Fixed Redhat 7.3 build to use the libtool and autoconf253 packages
    already installed.  No need to use separate/updated versions.  I obviously
    didn't do my homework a couple of years ago.

  * r13822
    Greatly reduce disk space requirements during RPM build by telling each
    test pass to cleanup after successful tests.
