Candidate changes for 1.5.0:
============================

 * r31059, 31060, 31061, 31075, 31151
   Fix issue #3157, Merging a change from a path's natural history
   creates self-referential mergeinfo
   Notes:
     r31075 and 31151 are the core fixes for the issue, the other revisions
     are a new test for it (and a few minor follow-ups to that test).
     The addition of the new merge test in r31059 trivally conflicts
     because several other new merge tests are not backported yet.

 * r30629, r30787
    mod_dontdothat: Allow opt-out of replay rejection.
    Notes:

 * r31243, r31246, r31249, r31250, r31251
   Fix issue #3200, API Ickiness:  svn_client_ctx_t shouldn't carry
   "extra revprops"; the svn_client APIs should
   Backport branch:
     TBC (to be created)
   Notes:
     If we *don't* backport this in 1.5.0, we need to undo the changes
     or otherwise rework them to use newly-revved svn_client APIs.
     This is not quite finished -- need feedback from Ruby, Perl, and
     JavaHL bindings maintainers.

Candidate changes for 1.5.1:
============================

 * r31196, r31199
   Don't commit an add of a missing item (issue #3198).
   Notes:
     r31199 is a trivial followup that adds a missing SVN_ERR() wrap.
