This file tracks the status of releases in the 1.4.x line.

See "Stabilizing and maintaining releases" in trunk/www/hacking.html for
details on how release lines and voting work, what kinds of bugs can
delay a release, etc.

Status of 1.4.0:
================

Candidate changes:

  * r20781, r21192
    autogen.sh: Purge *.pyc files from the build/ hierarchy after using the
    build generator, so that we do not ship them in tarballs.
    Justification:
      Shipping detritus like .pyc files in release tarballs is sloppy.
    Votes:
      +1: maxb
      -1: cmpilato (this is a very odd place to do this.  dist.sh, perhaps?)

  * /branches/1.4.x-fixwarn, no corresponding trunk revision
    Fix GCC warnings in libsvn_wc/merge.c:
    merge.c: In function 'svn_wc__merge_internal':
    merge.c:178: warning: declaration of 'tmp_left' shadows a previous local
    merge.c:50: warning: shadowed declaration is here
    merge.c:178: warning: declaration of 'tmp_right' shadows a previous local
    merge.c:50: warning: shadowed declaration is here
    The problem is that the variable names tmp_left and tmp_right were removed
    on trunk, and then later re-introduced for a different purpose.  The
    re-introduction was then backported to 1.4.x branch, on which the initial
    removal never took place.  Therefore, the same variable names are being
    used for two different purposes in the same function.  Badness.
    Justification:
      We usually build OK with -Werror -Wall -Wno-uninitialized, but this
      issue breaks that.
    Notes:
      rs=http://svn.collab.net/repos/svn

  * r21190
    Bump repos format number, to protect against 1.0 and 1.1 ignoring the FS
    format number.
