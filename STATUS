Status of 1.2.2:
================

Candidate changes:

  * /branches/1.2.x-get-locks  (merge r15424:HEAD)
    Client bugfix:  make 'svn st -u' work against pre-1.2 mod_dav_svn.
    Justification:
      A serious backward-compatibility bug!  Very small codechange.
    Notes:
      The actual backported revisions are r15359, r15423... but the
      branch was required to fix a trivial conflict.

  * /branches/1.2.x-authz  (merge r15465:HEAD)
    mod_authz_svn bugfix: bad path-matching in recursive logic.
    Justification:
      It's possible to get authz failures when they shouldn't exist.
    Notes:
      See the original bug report at 
      http://subversion.tigris.org/servlets/ReadMsg?listName=users&msgNo=35734

  * r15248
    Perl bindings: Make compatible with SWIG 1.3.25.
    Justification:
      Distributions will start to update to the new version, and will
      require support to continue building subversion-perl packages.

      +1: maxb, clkao

  * r15253
    Fix Issue #2341: Perl bindings cat method fails when using a local file
    repository.
    Justification:
      Repeatedly using the client context to cat files via ra_local from the
      bindings eventually causes the interpreter to die without this fix.

  * r15552
    Fix bug in loading of Subversion's JNI library by SVNClient.
    Justification:
      Critical bug fix of any users who need to use their own copy of
      the SVN libraries (e.g. rather than use the system installed
      version).
    Votes:
      +1: dlr

  * r15337
    Fix cut-n-paste problem with JNI stack name in javahl client
    bindings.
    Justification:
      Produce correct diagnostics from JNI errors.
    Votes:
      +1: dlr

  * r15379, r15398
    Fix memleak in character translation handle caching.
    Justification:
      Leaks are bad.

      +1: lundblad

  * r15450
    Allow SVN::Pool type to be used as a pool parameter in the Perl
    bindings.
    Justification:
      The default allocator for client returns a SVN::Pool type,
      but clients can't actually pass it to individual client
      commands without this patch.

  * r15516
    A one line fix for an "svn export wc_path" client SEGV.
    Justification:
      It's a crash.

Approved changes (further review is welcome, but not required):


  * r14008, r14458, r14587, r14632, r15329, r15340
    Fixes to svnmerge.
    Justification:
      It would be good to have contrib code be the latest and fixed
      version.  We don't guarantee that this code works, but it would
      be good to have known fixes released.  This fixes four issues.
      Blair has used the code in trunk in a production environment and
      it works great.

  * r15233
    Reduce memory consumption by the client when performing merge
    operations.
    Justification:
      Consuming 2GB of memory while performing a merge on a large
      working copy is bad.
    Votes:
      +1: jszakmeister, lundblad, sussman

  * r15315
    Resolve location-tracing performance issue against 1.0.x servers.
    Justification:
      We can be pretty stupidly slow in many cases; can encourage
      people to stay at 1.0.x and 1.1.x clients instead of upgrading.
