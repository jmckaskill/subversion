This file tracks the status of releases in the 1.2.x line.

See "Stabilizing and maintaining releases" in trunk/HACKING for
details on how release lines and voting work, what kinds of bugs can
delay a release, etc.

Status of 1.2.2:
================

Candidate changes:

  * r15703
    Fix client crash with "svn lock" against the tigris.org SVN server.
    Justification:
      It's a crash, right.
    Votes:
      +1: brane

  * r15705
    Fix a latent bug in FSFS's directory cache which caused fs-test 13
    to fail.
    Justification:
      Possible results in repository of dubious integrity if the cache
      was wrong in just the right ways.  (Unverified.)
    Notes:
      In 1.2.x, there is no fs-test 13 for FSFS, so verification might
      have to be done hackily (perhaps by changing hardcoded "bdb" in 
      libsvn_fs_base/fs-test.c's delete () test to be "fsfs").

Approved changes (further review is welcome, but not required):

  * r15683
    Include missing header in core.i.
    Justification:
      Bindings only. Silences compiler warnings when generating Python
      bindings on Windows.

      +0: djames

  * r15695, r15700
    Fix a bug in SVN::Core::Stream's read function.
    Justification:
      Bindings only.  Correctness issue for $root->file_contents
      on a file with "0" in the content.
